7</span>NOTE.</h2>
<p>I designed this story, and, indeed, began to write it, between
the publication of <i>Tales of Mean Streets</i> and that of <i>A
Child of the Jago</i>, to be read together with those books: not
that I pretend to figure in all three&mdash;much less in any one
of them&mdash;a complete picture of life in the eastern parts of
London, but because they are complementary, each to the two
others.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">A. M.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>TO
LONDON TOWN.<br />
I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> afternoon had slumbered in the
sun, but now the August air freshened with an awakening breath,
and Epping Thicks stirred and whispered through a myriad
leaves.&nbsp; Far away beyond the heaving greenwoods distant
clouds floated flat on the upper air, and a richer gold grew over
the hills as the day went westward.&nbsp; This way and that,
between and about trees and undergrowth, an indistinct path went
straggling by easy grades to the lower ground by Wormleyton Pits;
an errant path whose every bend gave choice of green passes
toward banks of heather and bracken.&nbsp; It was by this way
that an old man and a crippled child had reached the Pits.&nbsp;
He was a small old man, white-haired, and a trifle bent; but he
went his way with a sturdy tread, satchel at side and
butterfly-net in hand.&nbsp; As for the child, she too went
sturdily enough, but she hung from a crutch by the right
shoulder, and she moved with a <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>jog and a swing.&nbsp; The hand that
gripped the crutch gripped also a little bunch of meadowsweet,
and the other clasped tight against her pinafore a tattered old
book that would else have fallen to pieces.</p>
<p>Once on the heathery slade, the old man lifted the strap over
his head and put the satchel down by a tree clump at the
wood&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Nother rest for you, Bess,&rdquo; he said, as he
knelt to open his bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; over
the pits pretty close to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; He packed his pockets
with pill-boxes, a poison bottle, and a battered, flat tin case;
while the child, with a quick rejection of the crutch, sat and
watched.</p>
<p>The old man stood, slapped one pocket after another, and then,
with a playful sweep of the net-gauze across the child&rsquo;s
face, tramped off among the heather.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good luck,
gran&rsquo;dad!&rdquo; she cried after him, and settled on her
elbow to read.</p>
<p>The book needed a careful separation, being open at back as at
front; likewise great heed lest the leaves fell into confusion:
for, since they were worn into a shape more oval than
rectangular, the page numbers had gone, and in places corners of
text had gone too.&nbsp; But the main body of the matter, thumbed
and rubbed, stood good for many a score more readings; and the
story was <i>The Sicilian Romance</i>.</p>
<p>Round about the pits and across the farther ground <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of Genesis
Slade the old man pushed his chase.&nbsp; Now letting himself
cautiously down the side of a pit; now stealing softly among
bracken, with outstretched net; and again running his best
through the wiry heather.&nbsp; Always working toward sun and
wind, and often standing watchfully still, his eye alert for a
fluttering spot amid the flood of colour about him.</p>
<p>Meantime the little cripple conned again the familiar periods
of the old romance.&nbsp; Few, indeed, of its ragged leaves but
might have been replaced, if lost, from pure memory; few, indeed,
for that matter, of <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> or of
<i>Susan Hopley</i>, or of <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i>: worn
volumes all, in her grandfather&rsquo;s little shelf of a dozen
or fifteen books.&nbsp; So that now, because of old acquaintance,
the tale was best enjoyed with many pauses; pauses filled with
the smell of the meadowsweet, and with the fantasy that abode in
the woods.&nbsp; For the jangle of a herd-bell was the clank of a
knight&rsquo;s armour, the distant boom of a great gun at Waltham
Abbey told of the downfall of enchanted castles, and in the
sudden plaint of an errant cow she heard the growling of an ogre
in the forest.</p>
<p>The western hillsides grew more glorious, and the sunlight,
peeping under heavy boughs, flung along the sward, gilt the
tree-boles whose shadows veined it, and lit nooks under bushes
where the wake-robin raised its scarlet mace of berries.&nbsp;
The old man had dropped his <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>net, and for awhile had been
searching the herbage.&nbsp; It was late in the day for
butterflies, but fox-moth caterpillars were plenty among the
heather; as well as others.&nbsp; Thus Bessy read and dreamed,
and her grandfather rummaged the bushes till the sunlight was
gathered up from the turf under the trees, and lifted from the
tallest spire among the agrimony, as the sun went beyond the
hill-tops.&nbsp; Then at last the old man returned to his
satchel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flies ain&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; he observed, as
Bessy looked up, &ldquo;but for trade it&rsquo;s best not to miss
anything: it&rsquo;s always what you&rsquo;re shortest of as
sells; and the blues was out late to-day.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve
got luck with caterpillars.&nbsp; If they go all right I ought to
have a box-full o&rsquo; Rosy Marbled out o&rsquo;
these!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosy Marbled!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a late brood then.&nbsp;
And so long since you had any!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two year; and this is the only place for
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man packed his bag and slung it
across his back.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about tea
now,&rdquo; he added, as the child rose on her crutch; &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll keep open eyes as we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the slade they took their way, where the purple carpet
was patterned with round hollows, black with heather-ash and
green with star-moss; by the edges of the old gravel-pits,
overhung with bramble and bush; and so into more woods.</p>
<p>A jay flew up before them, scolding angrily.&nbsp; Now <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and again a
gap among the trees let through red light from beyond
Woodredon.&nbsp; Again and again the old man checked his walk,
sometimes but to drop once more into his even tramp, sometimes to
stop, and sometimes to beat the undergrowth and to shake
branches.&nbsp; To any who saw there was always a vaguely
familiar quality in old May&rsquo;s walk; ever a patient plod,
and, burdened or not, ever an odd suggestion of something carried
over shoulder; matters made plain when it was learned that the
old man had been forty years a postman.</p>
<p>Presently as they walked they heard shrieks, guffaws, and a
discordant singing that half-smothered the whine of a
concertina.&nbsp; The noise was the louder as they went, and when
they came where the white of a dusty road backed the tree-stems,
they heard it at its fullest.&nbsp; Across the way was an inn,
and by its side a space of open ground whereon some threescore
beanfeasters sported at large.&nbsp; Many were busy at
kiss-in-the-ring, some waved branches torn from trees, others
stood up empty bottles and flung more bottles at them; they
stood, sat, ran, lay, and rolled, but each made noise of some
sort, and most drank.&nbsp; Plainly donkey-riding had palled, for
a man and a boy had gathered their half-dozen donkeys together,
and were driving them off.</p>
<p>The people were Londoners, as Bessy knew, for she had often
seen others.&nbsp; She had forgotten London herself&mdash;all of
it but a large drab room with a row of little <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>beds like her
own, each bed with a board on it, for toys; and this, too, she
would have forgotten (for she was very little indeed then) but
that a large and terrible gentleman had come every day and hurt
her bad leg.&nbsp; It was the Shadwell Hospital.&nbsp; But these
were Londoners, and Bessy was a little afraid of them, and
conceived London to be a very merry and noisy place, very badly
broken, everywhere, by reason of the Londoners.&nbsp; Other
people, also, came in waggonettes, and were a little quieter, and
less gloriously bedecked.&nbsp; She had seen such a party earlier
in the day.&nbsp; Probably they were not real Londoners, but folk
from parts adjoining.&nbsp; But these&mdash;these were Londoners
proper, wearing each other&rsquo;s hats, with paper wreaths on
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wayo, old &rsquo;un!&rdquo; bawled one, as the old man,
net in hand, crossed toward the wood opposite; &ldquo;bin
ketchin&rsquo; tiddlers?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned to his
companions with a burst of laughter and a jerk of the
thumb.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;year, Bill!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s
yer ole gran&rsquo;father ketchin&rsquo; tiddlers!&nbsp; Why
doncher keep &rsquo;im out o&rsquo; mischief?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
every flushed face, doubly reddened by the setting sun, turned
and opened its mouth in a guffaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll cop
it for gittin&rsquo; yer trouseys wet!&rdquo; screamed a
woman.&nbsp; And somebody flung a lump of crust.</p>
<p>Bessy jogged the faster into the wood, and in its shadow her
grandfather, smiling doubtfully, said, &ldquo;They <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>like their
joke, some of &rsquo;em, don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
always &rsquo;tiddlers&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It grew dusk under the trees, and the sky was pale
above.&nbsp; They came to where the ground fell away in a glen
that was almost a trench, and a brook ran in the ultimate
furrow.&nbsp; On the opposing hill a broad green ride stood like
a wall before them, a deep moss of trees clinging at each
side.&nbsp; Here they turned, and, where the glen widened, a
cottage was to be seen on sloping ground, with a narrow roadway a
little beyond it.&nbsp; A whitewashed cottage, so small that
there seemed scarce a score of tiles on its roof; one of the few
scattered habitations holding its place in the forest by right of
ancient settlement.&nbsp; A little tumult of garden tumbled about
the cottage&mdash;a jostle of cabbages, lavender, onions,
wallflowers and hollyhock, confined, as with difficulty, by a
precarious fence, patched with wood in every form of manufacture
and in every stage of decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect mother and Johnny finished tea long
ago,&rdquo; Bessy remarked, her eyes fixed on the cottage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why there&rsquo;s a light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path they went by grew barer of grass as it neared the
cottage, and as they trod it, men&rsquo;s voices could be heard
from within, and a woman&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like visitors!&rdquo; the old man
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd.&nbsp; I wonder who . .
. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are then, father!&rdquo; came a female voice
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>from the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Uncle Isaac an&rsquo; a gentleman
come to see us.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Bessy&rsquo;s mother who
spoke&mdash;a pleasant, fresh, active woman in a print dress, who
stood in the doorway as the old man set back the gate.</p>
<p>The door opened into the living-room, where sat two men, while
a boy of fourteen squeezed, abashed and a trifle sulky, in a
corner.&nbsp; There was a smell of bad cigar, which had almost,
but not quite, banished the wonted smell of the room; a smell in
some degree due to camphor, though, perhaps, more to caterpillar;
for the walls were hidden behind boxes and drawers of divers
shapes and sizes, and before the window and in unexpected places
on the floor stood other boxes, covered with muslin, nurseries
for larv&aelig;, pup&aelig;, and doomed butterflies.&nbsp; And so
many were these things that the room, itself a mere box, gave
scant space to the three people and the little round table that
were in it; wherefore Bessy&rsquo;s mother remained in the
doorway, and Uncle Isaac, when he rose, took a very tall hat from
the floor and clapped it on his head for lack of other safe
place; for the little table sustained a load of cups and
saucers.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac was a small man, though with a large
face; a face fringed about with grey wisps of whisker, and
characterised by wide and glassy eyes and a great tract of shaven
upper lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, Mr. May, good evenin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
said Uncle Isaac, shaking hands with the air of a man faithful to
a <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>friend
in defiance of the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my friend Mr.
Butson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butson was a tall, rather handsome man of forty or
thereabout, with curly hair and whiskers, and he greeted the old
man with grum condescension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Butson,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac continued, with a wave
of the hand, &ldquo;is a gentleman at present in connection with
the steamboat profession, though above it by fam&rsquo;ly and
inclination.&nbsp; Mr. Butson an&rsquo; me &rsquo;as bin
takin&rsquo; a day&rsquo;s &rsquo;olludy with a seleck party by
name of beanfeast, in brakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; responded old May, divesting himself of
his bag; &ldquo;we passed some of &rsquo;em by the Dun Cow,
an&rsquo; very merry they was, too, with concertinas, an&rsquo;
kiss-in-the-ring, an&rsquo; what not&mdash;very gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O damn, no,&rdquo; growled the distinguished
Butson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that low lot.&nbsp; He means that coster
crowd in vans,&rdquo; he added, for Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s
enlightenment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t fell as low as
that.&nbsp; Lor, no.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sucked savagely at the butt
of his cigar, found it extinct, looked vainly for somewhere to
fling it, and at last dropped it into a teacup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. May, no; not them lot,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac said,
with a touch of grave reproof.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a man of some
little property meself, an&rsquo; in company of Mr. Butson, by
nature genteel-disposed, I should be far from mixin&rsquo; with
such.&nbsp; We come down with the shipwrights an&rsquo; engineers
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>from
Lawsonses.&nbsp; That was prob&rsquo;ly Mr. May&rsquo;s little
joke, Mr. Butson.&nbsp; Mr. May is a man of property hisself,
besides a man of science, as I think I told you.&nbsp; This
&rsquo;ere land an&rsquo; residence bein&rsquo; in pint.&nbsp; If
any man was to come an&rsquo; say to Mr. May, &lsquo;Git out
o&rsquo; that property, Mr. May,&rsquo; what would the lawr say
to that man?&nbsp; Nullavoid.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what the lawr
&rsquo;ud say.&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud say, &lsquo;Git out yerself,
your claim&rsquo;s nullavoid.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Uncle Isaac,
checking a solemn thump at the table just in time to save the
tea-cups, took his hat off instead, and put it on again.</p>
<p>Mr. Butson grunted &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and Mrs. May, taking the
net, squeezed in, with Bessy behind her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
put a few o&rsquo; these boxes on the stairs, an&rsquo; make more
room,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The kettle&rsquo;s still
boiling in the backhouse, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make some more
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessy had a habit of shyness in presence of strangers, and
Uncle Isaac ranked as one, for it was two years at least since he
had been there before.&nbsp; Indeed, what she remembered of him
then made her the shyer.&nbsp; For he had harangued her very
loudly on the gratitude she owed her grandfather, calling her a
cripple very often in course of his argument, and sometimes a
burden.&nbsp; She knew that she was a cripple and a burden, but
to be held tightly by the arm and told so, by a gentleman with
such a loud voice and such large eyes as Uncle Isaac, somehow
inclined her to cry.&nbsp; So now, as soon as might be, she
joined her brother, and the two <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>retreated into the shadowy corner
between the stairfoot and the backhouse door.</p>
<p>The old butterfly-hunter, too, was shy in his more elderly
way.&nbsp; Beyond his widowed daughter-in-law and her two
children he had scarce an acquaintance, or at least none more
familiar than the naturalists in London to whom he sold his
specimens.&nbsp; So that now, in presence of this very genteel
Mr. Butson, who, he feared, was already disgusted at the humble
character of the establishment, he made but a hollow meal.&nbsp;
A half-forgotten notion afflicted him, that it was proper to
drink tea in only one of two possible ways; but whether from the
cup or from the saucer he could not resolve himself.&nbsp; Mr.
Butson had finished his tea, so that his example was lacking:
though indeed the lees in his saucer seemed to offer a
hint&mdash;a hint soon triumphantly confirmed by Uncle Isaac, who
was nothing averse from a supplementary cup, and who emptied it
straightway into his saucer and gulped ardently, glaring
fearfully over the edge.&nbsp; Whereat his host drank from the
saucer also, and took heed to remember for the future.&nbsp;
Still he was uncomfortable, and a little later he almost blushed
at detecting himself inhospitably grateful for signs that Mr.
Butson began to tire of the visit.&nbsp; Meanwhile he modestly
contributed little to the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Butson gloomily after a long pause,
and in reply to nothing in particular, &ldquo;<i>I</i>
ain&rsquo;t a man of <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>property.&nbsp; I wish I was.&nbsp;
If people got what they was brought up to&mdash;but
there!&rdquo;&nbsp; He stuck his hands lower in his pockets and
savagely regarded vacancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Butson&rsquo;s uncle,&rdquo; said Uncle Isaac,
&ldquo;is a mayor.&nbsp; A mayor.&nbsp; An&rsquo; &rsquo;is other
relations is of almost equal aristocracy.&nbsp; But &rsquo;e
won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave nothin&rsquo; to say to &rsquo;em, not a
word.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s jist blood&mdash;pride o&rsquo;
breedin&rsquo;.&nbsp; But what I say is, it may be proper
self-respeck, but it ain&rsquo;t proper self-justice.&nbsp; It
ain&rsquo;t self-justice, in my way o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo;
it.&nbsp; Why &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t even name &rsquo;em!&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t name &rsquo;em, Mr. May!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; the old man answered, rather
tamely, &ldquo;dear, dear!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Butson laid his head
back, jerked his chin, and snorted scorn at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;won&rsquo;t as much as name &rsquo;em, such is
&rsquo;is lawfty contemp&rsquo;.&nbsp; Otherwise, what &rsquo;ud
be my path of dooty?&nbsp; My path of dooty on behalf of
self-justice to Mr. Butson would be to see &rsquo;em an&rsquo;
put a pint o&rsquo; argument.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere, I puts it, is
&rsquo;im, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ere is me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere is Mr.
&rsquo;Enery Butson, your very dootiful relation of
fash&rsquo;nable instinks, an&rsquo; a engineer than which none
better though much above it, an&rsquo; unsuitably enchained by
worldly circumstances in the engine-room of a penny
steamer.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Here Mr. Butson snorted again.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Likewise &rsquo;ere is me, a elderly man of some small
property, an&rsquo; a shipwright of practical experience.&nbsp;
Them circumstances bein&rsquo; the case, cons&rsquo;kently, what
more nachral an&rsquo; proper than a <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>partnership&mdash;<i>with</i>
capital.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s &rsquo;ow I&rsquo;d put the pint; a
partnership <i>with</i> capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; so,&rdquo; said old May.&nbsp; And seeing
that the other still paused, he added &ldquo;Of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;e&rsquo;s proud&mdash;proud!&rdquo; said
Uncle Isaac, shaking his head plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps I am proud,&rdquo; Mr. Butson admitted
candidly, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I got my faults.&nbsp; But I
wouldn&rsquo;t take a penny from &rsquo;em&mdash;not if they was
to beg me on their knees.&nbsp; Why I&rsquo;d sooner be
be&rsquo;olding to strangers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that &rsquo;e would,&rdquo; sighed Uncle
Isaac.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t self-justice.&nbsp; No, it
ain&rsquo;t self-justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s self-respect, any&rsquo;ow,&rdquo; said Mr.
Butson sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they like to treat me unnatural,
let &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; observed Uncle Isaac, &ldquo;some
fam&rsquo;lies is unnachral an&rsquo; some is nachral, an&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s a deal o&rsquo; difference between &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
Look at Mr. May now.&nbsp; &rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t altogether in my
family, though my niece&rsquo;s father-in-law by marriage.&nbsp;
But what nachralness!&nbsp; His son was a engineer in yer own
trade, Mr. Butson,&mdash;fitter at Maidment&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E left my niece a widder, cons&rsquo;kence of a coat-tail
in a cog wheel.&nbsp; What does Mr. May do?&nbsp; Why &rsquo;e
shows &rsquo;is nachralness.&nbsp; &rsquo;E brings &rsquo;er
an&rsquo; &rsquo;er children down &rsquo;ere on &rsquo;is own
free&rsquo;old residence, an&rsquo;
cons&rsquo;kently&mdash;&rsquo;ere they are.&nbsp; Look at
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a principle with Uncle Isaac to neglect no opportunity
of reciting at large the excellences of any <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>person of the
smallest importance with whom he might be acquainted; or the
excellences which that person might be supposed to desire credit
for: if in his actual presence, so much the better.&nbsp; Nothing
could be cheaper, and on the whole it paid very well.&nbsp; At
worst, it advertised an amiable character; and there remained
off-chances of personal benefit.&nbsp; Moreover the practice
solidified Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s reputation among his
acquaintances.&nbsp; For here, quoth each in his turn, was
plainly a man of sagacious discernment.&nbsp; The old postman,
however, was merely uneasy.&nbsp; To his mind it was nothing but
a matter of course that when his son died, the widow and children
should come under his own roof, and it was as a matter of course
that he had brought them there.&nbsp; But Bessy&rsquo;s mother
said simply:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s been a good
one to us, always.&rdquo;&nbsp; She, as well as the children,
called him &ldquo;gran&rsquo;dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; proceeded Uncle Isaac, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
&rsquo;im with as much to think about as a man of edication
too&mdash;wonderful.&nbsp; Why there&rsquo;s nothink as &rsquo;e
don&rsquo;t know in astronomy
an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; insectonomy.&nbsp;
Nothink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not astronomy,&rdquo; interjected old May, a little
startled by both counts of the imputation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
astronomy, Mr. Mundy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say yes,&rdquo; answered Uncle Isaac, with an
emphatic slap on the knee.&nbsp; &ldquo;Modesty under a
bushel&rsquo;s all very well, Mr. May, all very well, but I
know&mdash;I know!&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Astronomy, an&rsquo; medicamedica
an&rsquo; all the other classics.&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; Ah,
I&rsquo;d give best part o&rsquo; my small property, sich as it
is, for &rsquo;alf your edication, Mr. May!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was generally agreed in the family that Uncle Isaac was
very &ldquo;close&rdquo; as to this small property of his.&nbsp;
Nothing could induce him to speak of it with any particularity of
detail, and opinions varied as to its character.&nbsp; Still,
whatever it was, it sufficed to gain Uncle Isaac much deference
and consideration&mdash;the more, probably, because of its
mysterious character; a deference and a consideration which Uncle
Isaac could stimulate from time to time by cloudy allusions to
altering his will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Mr. Butson rising from his chair,
&ldquo;education never done me much good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, unforchnately!&rdquo; commented Uncle Isaac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d prefer property
meself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Butson made toward the door, and Uncle
Isaac prepared to follow.&nbsp; At this moment a harsh female
voice suddenly screamed from the darkness without.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!&nbsp; I almost fell over a blessed
&rsquo;ouse!&rdquo; it said, and there was a shrill laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask &rsquo;em the way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old May stepped over the threshold at the sound; but the
magnificence was stricken from the face of Mr. Butson.&nbsp; His
cheeks paled, his mouth and eyes opened together, and he shrank
back, even toward the stairfoot.&nbsp; Nobody marked him,
however, but the children, for attention was directed
without.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Djear! which way to the Dun Cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the lane?&rdquo; answered the old postman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Follow that to the right an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll come to
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bit farther than through the wood, but ye
can&rsquo;t go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;&nbsp; There were two women and a
man.&nbsp; The screaming woman said something to the others in a
quieter tone, in which, however, the word &ldquo;tiddlers&rdquo;
was plain to hear, and there was a laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good-night, ole chap,&rdquo; she bawled back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em in a jam-pot with a bit o&rsquo;
water-creese!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full o&rsquo; their games!&rdquo; remarked the old man
with a tolerant smile, as he turned toward the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was the person as said I&rsquo;d catch it for
gettin&rsquo; my clothes wet, as we came past the Dun
Cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices of the beanfeasters abated and ceased, and now Mr.
Butson left no doubt of his readiness to depart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, with chap-fallen briskness,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to git back to the others;
they&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took leave with so
much less dignity and so much more haste than accorded with his
earlier manner that Mr. May was a trifle puzzled, though he soon
forgot it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Mr. May, I wish you good-night,&rdquo; said
Uncle Isaac, shaking hands impressively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
greatly enjoyed your flow of conversation, Mr. May.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He made after the impatient Butson, stopped half-way to the gate
and called gently:&mdash;&ldquo;Nan!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Yes, uncle,&rdquo; Mrs. May replied, stepping out
to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac whispered gravely in her ear, and she returned and
whispered to the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; he said, looking mightily
concerned, as he re-entered the cottage.</p>
<p>Mrs. May reached a cracked cup from a shelf, and, turning over
a few coppers, elicited a half-crown.&nbsp; With this she
returned to Uncle Isaac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a note of it,&rdquo; said Uncle Isaac
as he pocketed the money, &ldquo;and send a
postal-order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t trouble about that, Uncle
Isaac!&rdquo;&nbsp; For Uncle Isaac, with the small property,
must not be offended in a matter of a half-crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; Trouble?&rdquo; he ejaculated, deeply
pained.&nbsp; &ldquo;To pay my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&mdash;come on!&rdquo; growled Mr. Butson
savagely from the outer gloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And they went together, taking the lane in the direction opposite
to that lately used by the noisy woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; old May observed, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
often have visitors, an&rsquo; I was glad to see your Uncle
Isaac, Nan.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Mr. Butson, too,&rdquo; he added
impartially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Bessy&rsquo;s mother
innocently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such a gentleman, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I forgot,&rdquo; the old man
said <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might ha&rsquo; asked &rsquo;em
to take a drop o&rsquo; beer &rsquo;fore they went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had some while they was waitin&rsquo; for
tea.&nbsp; An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think
there&rsquo;s much left.&rdquo;&nbsp; She dragged a large tapped
jar from under the breeding-box at the window, and it was
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; was all the old man&rsquo;s comment, as he
surveyed the jar thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Presently he turned into the back-house and emerged with a tin
pot and a brush.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a goin&rsquo;
treaclin&rsquo; a bit,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy pulled his cap from his pocket, fetched a lantern, and
was straightway ready, while Bessy sat to her belated tea.</p>
<p>The last pale light lay in the west, and the evening offered
up an oblation of sweet smells.&nbsp; All things that feed by
night were out, and nests were silent save for once and again a
sleepy twitter.&nbsp; Every moment another star peeped, and then
one more.&nbsp; The boy and the old man walked up the slope among
the trees, pausing now at one, now at another, to daub the bark
with the mixture of rum and treacle that was in the pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always best to be careful where you treacle
when there&rsquo;s holiday folk about,&rdquo; said Johnny&rsquo;s
grandfather.&nbsp; &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp;
Often I&rsquo;ve treacled a log or a stump and found a couple
sittin&rsquo; on it when <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>I came back&mdash;with new dresses,
and sich.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no good explainin&rsquo;&mdash;they
think it&rsquo;s all done for practical jokin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s best to go on an&rsquo; take no notice.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve heard &rsquo;em say:&mdash;&rsquo;Don&rsquo;t the
country smell lovely?&rsquo;&mdash;meanin&rsquo; the smell
o&rsquo; the rum an&rsquo; treacle they was a-sittin&rsquo;
on.&nbsp; But when they find it&mdash;lor, the language I
<i>have</i> heard!&nbsp; Awful! . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was quiet almost all the round.&nbsp; Presently he
said, &ldquo;Gran&rsquo;dad, do you <i>really</i> like that
likeness I made of mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it, my boy?&nbsp; Why o&rsquo; course.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a nobby picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Isaac said it was bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a thoughtful pause while they
tramped toward the next tree.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only
Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s little game, Johnny.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t
mind that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a nobby picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Uncle Isaac knows anything about
it,&rdquo; said the boy vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
he&rsquo;s ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Johnny, Johnny!&rdquo; cried his
grandfather.&nbsp; &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, you know.&nbsp;
Not at all.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t say things like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I <i>think</i>,
gran&rsquo;dad.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I know he says things
wrong.&nbsp; When he came before he said that ship I drew was
bad&mdash;an&rsquo; I&mdash;I very near cried.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He
did cry, but that was in secret, and not to be confessed.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; Johnny went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fourteen,
an&rsquo; <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>I know better.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe Uncle Isaac
knows a bit about things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had come again to the tree first treacled, and, leaving
the pot and brush at its foot, the old man, by help of the
lantern, took certain of the moths that had been attracted.&nbsp;
From this he carried the lantern to the next tree in the round
and then to the next, filling the intervals between his
moth-captures with successive chapters of a mild and rather vague
lecture on respect for elders.</p>
<p>It was dark night now, and the sky all a-dust with
stars.&nbsp; The old man and the boy took their way more by use
than by sight amid the spectral presences of the trees, whose
infinite whispering filled the sharpening air.&nbsp; They emerged
on high ground, whence could be seen, here the lights of Loughton
and there the lights of Woodford, and others more distant in the
flatter country.&nbsp; Here the night wind swept up lustily from
all Essex, and away from far on the Robin Hood Road came a rumble
and a murmur, and presently the glare of hand-lights red and
green, the sign and token of homing beanfeasters.</p>
<h2><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some while a problem had
confronted the inmates of the cottage, and now it was ever with
them: the choice of a trade for Johnny.&nbsp; The situation of
the cottage itself made the main difficulty.&nbsp; There was a
walk of two miles to the nearest railway station, and then London
was twelve miles off.&nbsp; It was in London that trades were
learnt; but to get there?&nbsp; Here the family must stay, for
here was the cottage, which cost no rent, for the old man had
bought it with his little savings.&nbsp; Moreover, here also were
the butterflies and the moths, which meant butter to the dry
bread of the little pension; and here was the garden.&nbsp; To
part with Johnny altogether was more than his mother could face,
and, indeed, what was to pay for his lodging and keep?</p>
<p>The moths and butterflies could be no living for Johnny.&nbsp;
To begin with, though he was always ready to help in the
hatching, killing, setting, and what not, he was no born
insect-hunter, like his grandfather; and then the old man had
long realised that the forest was growing a poorer and poorer
hunting-ground each year, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and must some day (after he was dead,
he hoped) be no longer worth working.&nbsp; People were hard on
the hawks, so that insect-eating birds multiplied apace, and
butterflies were fewer.&nbsp; And there was something else, or so
it seemed&mdash;some subtle influence from the great smoky
province that lay to the south-west.&nbsp; For London grew and
grew, and washed nearer and still nearer its scummy edge of
barren brickbats and clinkers.&nbsp; It had passed Stratford long
since, and had nearly reached Leyton.&nbsp; And though Leyton was
eight miles off, still the advancing town sent something before
it&mdash;an odour, a subtle principle&mdash;that drove off the
butterflies.&nbsp; The old man had once taken the Emperor Moth at
Stratford, in a place long covered with a row of grimy little
houses; now the Emperor was none too easy to find in the thickest
of the woodland.&nbsp; And, indeed, when the wind came from the
south-west the air seemed less clear, in the old man&rsquo;s
eyes, than was its wont a dozen years back.&nbsp; True, many
amateurs came with nets&mdash;boys from boarding-schools
thereabout, chiefly&mdash;and did not complain.&nbsp; But he, who
by trade had noted day by day for many years the forest&rsquo;s
produce in egg, larva, pupa, and imago, saw and knew the
change.&nbsp; So that butterflies being beyond possibility as
Johnny&rsquo;s trade, his grandfather naturally bethought him of
the one other he himself was familiar with, and spoke of the
post-office.&nbsp; He knew the postmaster at Loughton, and the <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>postmasters
at other of the villages about the forest.&nbsp; By making a
little interest Johnny might take the next vacancy as
messenger.&nbsp; But the prospect did not tempt the boy.&nbsp; He
protested, and it was almost his sole contribution to the daily
discussion, that he wanted to make something; and there was
little doubt, if one might judge from the unpleasing ships and
figures in coloured chalks wherewith he defaced whatever offered
a fair surface, that he would most like to make pictures.&nbsp;
He never urged the choice in plain terms, for that were hopeless:
but both his mother and his grandfather condemned it in all
respects as though he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a deal more caterpillar than butterfly in
this life for the likes of us, my boy,&rdquo; the old man would
say, as he laboured at his setting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Makin&rsquo;
pictures an&rsquo; such is all very well, but we can&rsquo;t
always choose our own line.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve bin a lucky man in
my time, thank God.&nbsp; The insects was my hobby long
&rsquo;fore I made any money of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Your poor
gran&rsquo;mother that you never saw, &lsquo;A lot o&rsquo; good
them moths an&rsquo; grubs&rsquo;ll be to you,&rsquo; she used to
say.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why not bees, as you can make somethin&rsquo;
out of?&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; Haskins, that took the next round
to mine, he kep&rsquo; bees.&nbsp; But I began sellin&rsquo; a
few specimens to gentlemen here an&rsquo; there, an&rsquo; then
more, an&rsquo; after that I took &rsquo;em to London
reg&rsquo;lar, same as now.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t as good as it
was, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be worse, but I&rsquo;m
in hopes it&rsquo;ll last my time out.&nbsp; It was <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>because I was
carryin&rsquo; letters here that I had the chance o&rsquo;
doin&rsquo; it at all.&nbsp; If you was to carry &rsquo;em
yourself, you&rsquo;d be able to do something else too&mdash;bees
p&rsquo;raps.&nbsp; A good few mends boots, but we&rsquo;re a bit
off the villages here.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the house&mdash;yours
an&rsquo; your mother&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m gone, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m sixty-nine; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s healthier an&rsquo;
cleaner than London.&nbsp; You could put up a little bit o&rsquo;
glass in the garden an&rsquo; grow tomatoes an&rsquo;
cucumbers.&nbsp; Them&mdash;an&rsquo; fowls&mdash;you could keep
fowls&mdash;would sell very well to the gentlefolk, an&rsquo;
they all know the postman.&nbsp; Wages ain&rsquo;t high, but you
live cheap here, with no rent, and there&rsquo;s a pension,
p&rsquo;raps.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your line, depend on it,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I should like a trade where I could <i>make</i>
something,&rdquo; the boy would answer wistfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
really should, gran&rsquo;dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rdquo;&mdash;with a shake of the
head&mdash;&ldquo;make what?&nbsp; I doubt but you&rsquo;re
meanin&rsquo; pictures.&nbsp; You must get that notion out of
your head, Johnny.&nbsp; Some of them as make &rsquo;em may do
well, but most&rsquo;s awful.&nbsp; I see &rsquo;em in London
often, drorin&rsquo; on the pavement; reg&rsquo;lar clever ones,
too, doin&rsquo; mackerel an&rsquo; bits o&rsquo; salmon
splendid, and likenesses o&rsquo; the Queen, an&rsquo; sunsets,
with the sky shaded beautiful.&nbsp; Beggin&rsquo;!&nbsp;
Reg&rsquo;lar beggin&rsquo;, with a cap out for coppers,
an&rsquo; &lsquo;Help gifted poverty&rsquo; wrote in chalk.&nbsp;
<i>That</i> won&rsquo;t do, ye know, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s mother felt for him an indefinite ambition <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>not to be
realised by a life of letter-carrying, though picture-making she
favoured as little as did the old man.&nbsp; But there was the
situation of the cottage&mdash;a hindrance they could see no way
to overcome.&nbsp; This being so, they left it for the time, and
betook themselves to smaller difficulties.&nbsp; Putting the
letter-carrying aside for the moment, and forgetting distance as
an obstacle, what trades were there to choose from?&nbsp; Truly a
good many: and that none should be missed, Johnny&rsquo;s
grandfather took paper and a pencil and walked to Woodford, where
he begged use of a London Directory and read through all the
trades, from Absorbent Cotton Wool Manufacturers to Zincographic
Printers, making a laborious list as he went, omitting (with some
reluctance) such items as Bankers, Brokers&mdash;Stock and
Share&mdash;Merchants, Patentees, and Physicians, and hesitating
a little over such as A&euml;ronauts and Shive Turners.&nbsp; The
task filled a large part of three days of uncommonly hard work,
and old David May finished his list in mental bedevilment.&nbsp;
What was a Shive Turner?&nbsp; Indeed, for that matter, what was
an Ammeter?</p>
<p>The list did but multiply confusion and divide counsel.&nbsp;
Nan May sang less at her house-work now, thinking of what she
could remember of the trades that began with Absorbent Cotton
Wool Manufacture and ended with Zincographic Printing.&nbsp;
Little Bess neglected the bookshelf, and pored over the crabbed
catalogue <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>with earnest incomprehension.&nbsp; It afflicted Johnny
himself with a feeling akin to terror, for which he found it hard
to account.&nbsp; The arena of the struggle for bread was so
vast, and he so small a combatant to choose a way into the
scrimmage!&nbsp; More, it seemed all so unattractive.&nbsp; There
could be little to envy in the daily life of a Seed Crusher or a
Court Plaster Maker.&nbsp; But the old man would pin a sheet of
the list to the wall and study it while he worked within doors:
full of patience and simple courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bakin&rsquo; Powder Maker,&rdquo; he would call aloud
to whomsoever it might reach.&nbsp; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
that?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; something. . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes Bob Smallpiece, the forest keeper, would look in on
his way by the cottage and be consulted.&nbsp; Bob was an immense
being in much leather and velveteen, with a face like a long-kept
pippin.&nbsp; When he first came to the forest, years back, his
amiable peeps into the house may have been prompted by
professional considerations, for it was his habit to keep an eye
on solitary cottages in his walk: cottages wherein it had once or
twice been his luck to spy by surprise some furry little heap
that a poke of his ash stick had separated into dead
rabbits.&nbsp; Indeed, had old May&rsquo;s tastes lain that way,
nothing would have been easier for him than to set a snare or two
at night as he hunted his moths.&nbsp; But soon the keeper found
that this one, at <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>least, of the cottagers thereabouts was no poacher, and
then his greetings were as friendly as they seemed.&nbsp; As to
Johnny&rsquo;s trade, he had few ideas beyond one that butchers
did very well in London: his sister having married one.&nbsp; And
what a Shive Turner or an Ammeter might be he knew no more than
his stick.&nbsp; But he knew well enough what a poacher was (as
also, perhaps, did the stick, if contact could teach it); and he
counselled that the boy be kept away from certain
&ldquo;lots&rdquo;&mdash;as the &ldquo;Blandy lot,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Honeywell lot,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hayes
lot&rdquo;&mdash;who would do him no good.&nbsp; The old
butterfly-hunter knew these &ldquo;lots&rdquo; very well on his
own account; and his perpetual gropings about banks and
undergrowth made him no friends among them.&nbsp; They would
scarce believe, even after long experience, that grubs alone
accounted for his activity; and truly, a man with a government
pension, who affected scientific tastes, who lived a clean life,
who was called &ldquo;Mr. May&rdquo; by keepers, and who,
moreover, had such uncommon opportunities of witnessing what
passed in the woods, might well be an object of suspicion.&nbsp;
In simple truth, the village loafers had small conception of the
old man&rsquo;s knowledge of their behaviour among the rabbit
burrows.&nbsp; He knew the woods as they knew the inwards of a
quart pot, and his eyes, aged as they might be, were trained by
years of search for things well-nigh invisible amid grass,
leaves, and undergrowths.&nbsp; He could have <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>found their
wires blindfold, and he knew Joe Blandy&rsquo;s wires from Amos
Honeywell&rsquo;s better than Joe and Amos themselves.&nbsp; But
of all this he said nothing, holding himself a strict neutral,
and judging it best never to seem too knowing.&nbsp; Still it was
the fact that when the &ldquo;lots&rdquo; were periodically
weeded of members caught with disjoinable guns, wire nooses, or
dead things furred or feathered, those left behind were apt to
link circumstances together, and to regard the old man with doubt
and ill-favour.&nbsp; Once, indeed, he hung in doubt for days,
much tempted to carry a hint to Bob Smallpiece of a peculiarly
foul and barbarous manner of deer-stealing, wherein figured a
tied fawn, an anxious doe, a heavy stone, a broken leg, and a cut
throat.&nbsp; But it chanced that the keeper was otherwise aware,
and old May&rsquo;s doubt was determined by news that the thief,
waled and gory (for he had made a fight for it), had been brought
to the police-cells, with a dripping doe on a truck behind
him.&nbsp; Even now as Bob Smallpiece grinned in at the cottage
door one saw the gap where two teeth had gone in that
&ldquo;up-and-downer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the keeper, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do
the boy no good to let him knock about with nothing to do.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Bout here, specially.&nbsp; Boys that knocks about this
part mostly gets in wi&rsquo; them lots as we bin speakin&rsquo;
of, or something about as bad.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t there no
gentleman hereabout &rsquo;ud give him a job?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like him to learn a trade,&rdquo; the
old man said anxiously, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see how.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s always somethin&rsquo; to stand by, is a trade,
an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s what he wants.&nbsp; Wants to make
somethin&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way he puts it.&nbsp; Else
I&rsquo;d say post-office, same as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father was in the engineerin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
remarked Mrs. May, who had arrived at the door with certain
sticks of rhubarb from the garden.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
him to go to that, I think; but he can&rsquo;t, from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob Smallpiece knew nothing of engineering, and little more of
any other of the several trades read out from the list pinned to
the window-frame near which the old man worked at a
setting-stick.&nbsp; And presently he departed on his walk.&nbsp;
Bessy at the casement above saw him swing away toward the glen,
lifting his stick in recognition of Johnny, who bore a bundle of
dead sticks homeward.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s mother peeled and cut the rhubarb, revolving
impossible expedients for bridging the space between them and
London: the space that looked so small on the map, but was so
great an obstacle to their purposes, and so wide a division
between the two modes of life she knew.&nbsp; Johnny&rsquo;s
grandfather pinned and strapped deftly, deep in thought.&nbsp;
Presently, looking up, &ldquo;It beats me,&rdquo; he said,
fearful of ignoring some good thing in trades, &ldquo;to guess
what a Shive Turner is!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> life went at the cottage.&nbsp;
For a little while they looked for another visit from Uncle
Isaac; since, as he sent no postal order, it was felt that he
must defer the return of the half-crown merely because he
contemplated an early payment in person.&nbsp; But weeks passed
and nothing was heard of him, nor seen.&nbsp; Meantime the
problem of Johnny&rsquo;s trade met no solution.&nbsp; He had
left school nearly three months now, and, the thing seeming
desperate, he had well-nigh resolved to give in to the
post-office.&nbsp; At the thought London seemed a far and
wondrous place whereto he could never attain; and awe of the
terrible list his grandfather had compiled from the London
Directory, became longing for the least inviting trade in the
collection.&nbsp; He had his memories of London, too, and they
were more numerous and more pleasant than Bessy&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
There he could see, from his bedroom window, the masts of many
ships, quite close.&nbsp; In the strong winds (and in his
remembered London the weather was ever cold, brisk, dry, and
windy) the masts bent and rocked gravely, the ropes bellied, and
the blocks whistled aloud.&nbsp; At nights he lay and heard the
yards <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>groan and the cordage creak and rattle.&nbsp; Just by
the corner, ships sometimes thrust prying jib-booms clean over
the dock wall, as if to see what a town was like; and often he
had stood in the street to watch men climbing the rigging and
hanging bent over spars, like earwigs.&nbsp; He had gone
shopping, too, gripping tight at his mother&rsquo;s skirts, in
flaring market-streets, where everybody shouted at once, and
there were mountains of bulls&rsquo;-eyes and peppermint on
barrows.&nbsp; There was a street with shops on one side and a
blank wall on the other; and over and behind this wall, lifted
high in the air, was the monstrous skeleton of a great
ship.&nbsp; Men swarmed like ants about the skeleton, and all day
hammers went with a mighty clangour, and great lights flared at
night.&nbsp; There were big blank walls at all the places where
they made ships, and he could remember a little door in one such
wall, a door beyond which he greatly desired to see.&nbsp; But it
was rarely opened, and then but a little way, by an ill-natured
old man, who squeezed through and closed it very quickly.&nbsp;
So that Johnny believed he must issue thus to prevent the escape
of some small and active animal, imprisoned within.&nbsp; All
that Johnny remembered of his father was that he wiped his oily
hands on cotton waste: a curious stuff&mdash;like a great deal of
soft sewing-thread in a hopeless tangle&mdash;that he had never
seen since.&nbsp; That and the funeral: when he rode in a
carriage with a crape bow <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>pinned to his new jacket, and his
mother held his hand very tight at the grave-side.&nbsp; Most of
his memories were of the streets, and some revived after long
oblivion: as when the smell of roasted chestnuts brought a vision
of a glowing coke fire by the corner of the ship-yard wall, with
a pock-marked man behind it whom he would know anywhere
now.&nbsp; And he was not to return to this place of wistful
memory after all, nor to learn to make a ship nor an
engine&mdash;let alone a picture.</p>
<p>The weeks went, and berries hung where flowers had been.&nbsp;
Johnny and Bessy made their yearly harvest of blackberries, some
for puddings and jam at home, some to sell at such kitchen doors
as might receive them.&nbsp; Until an afternoon in early October:
when, with an order from a lady at Theydon, they betook
themselves in search of sloes.</p>
<p>Warm colours touched the woods to a new harmony, and seen from
high ground, they lay like flower-beds in green and red, yellow
and brown.&nbsp; The honeysuckle bloomed its second time, and
toadstools stood in crimson companies in the shade of the
trees.&nbsp; Sloes were rare this year near home, so the children
searched their way through the Wake Valley to Honey Lane
Quarters, and there they found their sloes, though few.</p>
<p>It was a long and scratchy task; and, when it was finished,
they were well up in St. Thomas&rsquo;s Quarters, and the sun was
setting.&nbsp; They made the best of their <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>way back as
far as the road near the Dun Cow, and there parted.&nbsp; For
Bessy was tired and hungry, and though Johnny was little better,
he resolved to carry his sloes fresh to Theydon and get the
money, since he was already a little on the way.&nbsp; So Bessy
turned up the lane that led to the cottage, and Johnny took to
the woods again for Theydon, by way to right of Wormleyton
Pits.</p>
<p>Dusk was growing to dark, but the boy stepped fearlessly, well
knowing his path.&nbsp; The last throstle sang his last evensong
for the year, and was still.&nbsp; The shadowy trees, so living
and so silent about him: the wrestling trunks of beeches, the
reaching arms of oak and hornbeam, all struck at gaze as though
pausing in their everlasting struggle to watch and whisper as he
passed: and the black depths between them might well have
oppressed the imagination of such a boy from other parts; but
Johnny tramped along among them little heeding, thinking of the
great ship-haunted London he longed for, and forecasting nothing
of the blow that should fall but in that hour and send him the
journey sorrowing.</p>
<p>Presently he was aware of a light ahead.&nbsp; It moved a foot
or two from the ground, and Johnny knew its swing.&nbsp; Then it
stopped, resting by a tree root.&nbsp; &ldquo;You,
gran&rsquo;dad?&rdquo; called Johnny, and &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;
came the old man&rsquo;s voice in answer.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>The old
man had cut a leaf, with a caterpillar on it, from a shrub, and
was packing it in a pill-box.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out for a few
night-feeders,&rdquo; he explained, as the boy stopped beside
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you ain&rsquo;t been home to tea,&rdquo; he
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;Takin&rsquo; home the sloes?&nbsp; Might
ha&rsquo; left &rsquo;em till the morning, John, easy,&mdash;now
you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I come up from over there&rdquo;&mdash;Johnny made
a vague toss of the arm&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; I thought I might
as well cut across to Theydon first.&nbsp; Bess went up the
lane.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be home &rsquo;fore ye now,
gran&rsquo;dad, &rsquo;nless you &rsquo;re goin&rsquo; back
straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be long behind ye; I&rsquo;m just
goin&rsquo; to the Pits.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make nothin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; them I took last night, under the brambles an&rsquo;
heather,&mdash;never saw the like before quite; so I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to see if there&rsquo;s more, an&rsquo; get all I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked together a few yards, till the trees
thinned.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go &rsquo;cross the
Slade,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Step it, or
you&rsquo;ll be beat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll step it,&rdquo; the boy answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want my tea.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He was trotting home by the lane from Theydon, with his empty
basket on his arm, and his hands (and the sixpence) in his
trousers pockets, when he checked at a sound, as of a cry from
the wood.&nbsp; But he heard no more, and trotted on.&nbsp;
Probably the deer were fighting somewhere; rare fighters were the
bucks in October.</p>
<h2><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Johnny</span> had finished his tea, and
was lying at his ease in the old easy-chair, whistling, rattling
his heels on the hearth, and studying a crack in the ceiling that
suggested an angry face.&nbsp; Mrs. May had put the sixpence the
sloes had brought into the cracked teacup that still awaited the
return of Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s half-crown, had washed the
tea-things, and was now mending the worn collar of
gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s great-coat, in readiness for the
winter.&nbsp; Bessy had fallen asleep over her book, had been
wakened, had fallen asleep again, and in the end had drowsily
climbed the stairs to early bed: but still the old man did not
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder gran&rsquo;dad ain&rsquo;t back yet,&rdquo;
Johnny&rsquo;s mother said for the third time.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
said he&rsquo;d be quick, so&rsquo;s to finish that case
to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a glass-topped mahogany box, in
course of setting with specimens of all the Sphinges: a special
private order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Spect he can&rsquo;t find them caterpillars he
went for,&rdquo; Johnny conjectured; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what it
is.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s forgot all about racin&rsquo; me
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. May finished the collar, lifted the coat by the <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>loop, and
turned it about in search of rents.&nbsp; Finding none, she put
it down and stood at the door, listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re too tired to go an&rsquo; look for
him, Johnny?&rdquo; she asked presently.</p>
<p>Johnny thought he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them
caterpillars, safe enough,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never
saw any before, an&rsquo; it was just a chance last night.&nbsp;
To-night he can&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em, and he&rsquo;s
keepin&rsquo; on searchin&rsquo; all over the Pits and the Slade;
that&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another pause, till Mrs. May remembered
something.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bit o&rsquo; candle he had in the
lantern wouldn&rsquo;t last an hour,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had to come back for more.&nbsp;
Johnny, I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what for?&rdquo; asked Johnny, though the
circumstance of the short candle startled his confidence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He might get a light from somewhere else, &rsquo;stead
o&rsquo; comin&rsquo; all the way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where?&rdquo; asked Mrs. May.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only the Dun Cow, an&rsquo; he might almost
as well come home&mdash;besides, he wouldn&rsquo;t ask
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny left the chair, and joined his mother at the
door.&nbsp; As they listened a more regular sound made itself
plain, amid the low hum of the trees; footsteps.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here he comes,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>But the sound neared and the steps were long and the tread was
heavy.&nbsp; In a few moments Bob Smallpiece&rsquo;s voice came
from the gloom, wishing them good-night.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Mrs.
May called to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you seen gran&rsquo;dad
anywhere, Mr. Smallpiece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keeper checked his strides, and came to the garden gate,
piebald with the light from the cottage door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t run across him,
nor seen his light anywheres.&nbsp; Know which way he
went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was just going to Wormleyton Pits an&rsquo; back,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve just come straight across the Pits,
an&rsquo; as straight here as ever I could go, past the Dun Cow;
an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t seen ne&rsquo;er a sign of him.&nbsp; Want
him particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; nervous about him, Mr.
Smallpiece&mdash;somehow I&rsquo;m frightened to-night.&nbsp; He
went out about six, an&rsquo; now it don&rsquo;t want much to
nine, an&rsquo; he only had a bit o&rsquo; candle that
wouldn&rsquo;t burn an hour.&nbsp; And he never meant stopping
long, I know, &rsquo;cause of a case he&rsquo;s got to set.&nbsp;
I thought p&rsquo;raps you might ha&rsquo; seen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I see nothin&rsquo; of him.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll go
back to the Pits now, if you like, an&rsquo; welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be sorry to bother you, but I would like
someone to go.&nbsp; Here, Johnny, go along, there&rsquo;s a good
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; the keeper exclaimed
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go together.&nbsp; I expect
he&rsquo;s invented some new speeches o&rsquo; moth, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;s forgot all about his light, thinkin&rsquo; out the
improvements.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;s been
out o&rsquo; night about here, anyhow.&nbsp; Not likely to lose
himself, is Mr. May.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Johnny
had his cap and was at the gate; and in a moment the keeper and
he were mounting the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s worryin&rsquo; herself over nothing
to-night,&rdquo; Johnny grumbled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s been later &rsquo;n this
many&rsquo;s a time, an&rsquo; she never said a word.&nbsp; Why,
when he gets after caterpillars an&rsquo; things he forgets
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on among the trees.&nbsp; Presently, &ldquo;How
long is it since your father died?&rdquo; Bob Smallpiece asked
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine years, now, and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother might ha&rsquo; married agen, I
s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno.&nbsp; Very likely.&nbsp; Never heard her say
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob Smallpiece walked on with no more reply than a
grunt.&nbsp; Soon a light from the Dun Cow twinkled through the
bordering coppice, and in a few paces they were up at the
wood&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No light along the road,&rdquo; the keeper said,
glancing to left and right, and making across the hard
gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed,
pointing up the pale road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunk,&rdquo; objected the other.&nbsp; And truly the
indistinct figure staggered and floundered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; goin&rsquo; the wrong way.&nbsp; Chap just out
o&rsquo; the Dun Cow.&nbsp; Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Johnny&rsquo;s gaze did not shift.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
gran&rsquo;dad!&rdquo; he cried suddenly, and started
running.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Bob
Smallpiece sprang after him, and in twenty paces they were
running abreast.&nbsp; As they neared the old man they could hear
him talking rapidly, in a monotonous, high-pitched voice; he was
hatless, and though they called he took no heed, but stumbled on
as one seeing and hearing nothing; till, as the keeper reached to
seize his arm, he trod in a gulley and fell forward.</p>
<p>The shock interrupted his talk, and he breathed heavily,
staring still before him, as he regained his uncertain foothold,
and reeled a step farther.&nbsp; Then Bob Smallpiece grasped him
above the elbow, and shouted his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, gran&rsquo;dad?&rdquo; Johnny
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man glared fixedly, and made as though to resume his
course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said Bob Smallpiece,
retaining the arm, and lifting a hand gently to the old
man&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp; It was blood, dotted and trickling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord! he&rsquo;s had a bad wipe over the head,&rdquo; said
Bob, and with that lifted old May in his arms, as a nurse lifts a
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Theydon&rsquo;s nearest; run, Johnny
boy&mdash;run like blazes an&rsquo; fetch the doctor
tantivy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him into the Dun Cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;home&rsquo;s best, an&rsquo; save
shiftin&rsquo; him twice.&nbsp; Run it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purple Emperors an&rsquo; Small Coppers,&rdquo; began
the <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>old
man again in his shrill chatter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Small Coppers
an&rsquo; Marsh Ringlets everywhere, and my bag full o&rsquo;
letters at the beginning of the round, but I finished my round
and now they&rsquo;re all gone; all gone because o&rsquo; London
comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I give in my empty bag&mdash;&rdquo; and
so he tailed off into indistinguishable gabble, while Bob
Smallpiece carried him into the wood.</p>
<p>To Johnny, scudding madly toward Theydon, it imparted a
grotesque horror, as of some absurd nightmare, this baby-babble
of his white-haired grandfather, carried baby-fashion.&nbsp; He
blinked as he ran, and felt his head for his cap, half believing
that he ran in a dream in very truth.</p>
<h2><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. May</span> still stood at the cottage
door, and the keeper, warned by the light, called from a little
distance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we are, Mrs. May,&rdquo; he said, as
cheerfully as might be.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all
right&mdash;just had a little accident, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
So I&rsquo;m carryin&rsquo; him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be frightened;
get a little water&mdash;I think he&rsquo;s got a bit of a cut on
the head.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s nothing to fluster about.&rdquo; .
. . And so assuring and protesting, Bob brought the old man
in.</p>
<p>The woman saw the staring grey face and the blood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O-o-o&mdash;my God!&rdquo; she quavered, stricken sick and
pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Keep steady and help.&nbsp;
Shift the table, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll put him down on the
rug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She mastered herself, and said no more.&nbsp; The old man,
whose babble had sunk to an indistinct mutter, was no sooner laid
on the floor than he made a vague effort to rise, as though to
continue on his way.&nbsp; But he was feebler than before, and
Bob Smallpiece pressed him gently back upon the new-mended coat,
doubled to make a pillow.</p>
<p>Nan May, tense and white, curbed her agitation, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>ministering
and suffering in silence.&nbsp; Years before a man had been
carried home to her thus, but then all was over, and after the
first numbness grief could take its vent.&nbsp; Once she asked
Bob Smallpiece, in a whisper, how it had happened.&nbsp; He told
how little he knew, and save for passing the words to Bessy,
wakened by unwonted sounds, Mrs. May said nothing.&nbsp; Bessy,
in her nightgown, sat on the stairs, hugging her crutch, and
sobbing with what quietness she could compel of herself.</p>
<p>There was a little brandy in a quartern bottle, and the keeper
thought it well to force the spirit between the old man&rsquo;s
teeth, while Mrs. May bathed the head and washed away the clotted
blood.&nbsp; As they did so the wheels of the doctor&rsquo;s
dog-cart were heard in the lane, and soon the doctor came in at
the door, pulling off his gloves.</p>
<p>Johnny stood, pale, helpless, and still almost breathless,
behind the group, while the doctor knelt at his
grandfather&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; There was a contused wound at the
top of the head, the doctor could see, a little back, not
serious.&nbsp; But blood still dripped from the ears, and the
doctor shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fracture of the base,&rdquo;
he said, as to himself.</p>
<p>Reviving a little, because of the brandy and the bathing, the
old man once more made a motion as if to <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>rise, his
eyes grew brighter, though fixed still, and his voice rose
distinctly as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;took the bag in, yes.&nbsp; London&rsquo;s
comin&rsquo; fast, London&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
a-frightenin&rsquo; out the butterflies.&nbsp; London&rsquo;s
a-drivin&rsquo; the butterflies out o&rsquo; my round, out
o&rsquo; my round, an&rsquo; butterflies can&rsquo;t live near
it.&nbsp; London&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; my round an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ve done my round an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;ll give in the
empty bag.&nbsp; Take the bag: an&rsquo; look for the
pension.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the &rsquo;vantage o&rsquo; the
Pos&rsquo;-Office, John.&nbsp; Some gets pensions but some
don&rsquo;, but the butterflies&rsquo;ll last my time I hope:
an&rsquo; Haskins he kep&rsquo; bees, but I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo;
to finish my roun&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; and so on and so on till
the voice fell again and the muttering was fainter than
before.</p>
<p>Bob Smallpiece stood awkwardly by, unwilling to remain a
useless intruder, but just as reluctant to desert friends in
trouble.&nbsp; Presently he bethought himself that work was still
to do in inquiry how the old man&rsquo;s hurt had befallen,
whether by accident or attack; perhaps, indeed, to inform the
police, and that in good time.&nbsp; So he asked, turning his hat
about in his hands, if there was anything else he could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more, Smallpiece, thanks,&rdquo; the doctor
said, with an unmistakable lift of the brows and a glance at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you for helpin&rsquo; us, Mr.
Smallpiece,&rdquo; Mrs. May said as she let him out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>how he is in the mornin&rsquo; if you
can&rsquo;t call.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the door was shut,
&ldquo;Go to bed, Johnny, my boy, and take a rest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But Johnny went no farther than the stairs, and sat there with
his sister.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s muttering ceased wholly, and he breathed
heavily, stertorously.&nbsp; The doctor rose to his feet and
turned to Mrs. May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me, sir,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very serious,&rdquo; the doctor said gravely; and
added with impressive slowness, &ldquo;very serious
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman took a grip of the table, and caught three quick
breaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must keep yourself calm, and you must bear
up.&nbsp; You must prepare yourself&mdash;in case of something
very bad indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice she tried to speak, but was mute; and then, &ldquo;No
hope?&rdquo; she said, more to sight than to hearing.</p>
<p>He put his hand kindly on her shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would
be wrong of me to encourage it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
for what I can do, it is all over. . . .&nbsp; But you must bear
up,&rdquo; he went on firmly, as, guided to a chair, she bent
forward and covered her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drink
this&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He took a small bottle from his bag,
poured something into a cup and added water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drink
it&mdash;drink it up; all of it. . . .&nbsp; I must go. . .
.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve your children to think of, remember.&nbsp;
Come to your mother, my boy. . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>He was
gone, and the children stood with their arms about their
mother.&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s breathing, which had grown
heavier and louder still, presently eased again, and his eyes
closed drowsily.&nbsp; At this the woman looked up with an
impossible hope in her heart.&nbsp; Truly, the breath was soft
and natural, and the drawn lines had gone from the face: he must
be sleeping.&nbsp; Why had she not thought to ask Bob Smallpiece
to carry him up to bed?&nbsp; And why had the doctor not ordered
it?&nbsp; Softly she turned the wet cloth that lay over the
wound.</p>
<p>The breath grew lighter and still lighter, and more peaceful
the face, till one might almost trace a smile.&nbsp; Quieter and
quieter, and still more peaceful: till all was peace indeed.</p>
<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Bob Smallpiece</span> and a
police-inspector busied themselves that night at Wormleyton
Pits.&nbsp; The pits were none of them deep&mdash;six feet at
most.&nbsp; At the bottom of the deepest they found old
May&rsquo;s lantern, with the glass broken and the candle overrun
and extinguished; and the gravel was spotted with marks which, in
the clearer light of the morning, were seen to be marks of
blood.&nbsp; It was useless to look for foot-prints.&nbsp; The
ground was dry, and, except in the pits themselves, it was
covered with heather, whereon no such traces were possible.&nbsp;
And this was all the police had to say at the inquest, whereat
the jury gave a verdict of Accidental Death.&nbsp; For the old
man had died, as was medically certified after post-mortem
examination, of brain-laceration produced by fracture of the base
of the skull; and the fracture was caused by percussion from a
blow on the upper part of the head&mdash;a blow probably suffered
by falling backward into the pit and striking the head against a
large stone embedded at the bottom.&nbsp; Everything suggested
such an explanation.&nbsp; Above the steepest wall of the pit,
over which the fall must have chanced, <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>a narrow ledge of ground ran between
the brink and a close clump of bramble and bush; and this ledge
was grown thick with tough heather, as apt, almost, as a tangle
of wire, to catch the foot and cause a stumble.&nbsp; It was
plain that, stooping to his occupation on this ledge, and perhaps
forgetting his situation in the interest of his search, he had
fallen backward into the pit with the lantern.&nbsp; He had
probably lain there insensible for some while, and then,
developing a crazed half-consciousness, he had crawled out by the
easy slope at the farther end, and staggered off whithersoever
his disjointed faculties might carry him.&nbsp; Nobody had seen
him but his grandson and the keeper; so that the verdict was a
matter of course, and the dismal inquiry was soon done
with.&nbsp; And indeed the jury knew all there was to know,
unless it were a trivial matter, of some professional interest to
Bob Smallpiece, about which the police preferred to have nothing
said; since it could not help the jury, though it might chance,
later, to be of some use to themselves.&nbsp; It was simply the
fact that several very fresh peg-holes were observed about the
pits, hinting a tearing away of rabbit-snares with no care to
hide the marks.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The days were bad dreams to Johnny.&nbsp; He found himself
continually repeating in his mind that gran&rsquo;dad was dead,
gran&rsquo;dad was dead; as though he were <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>forcing
himself to learn a lesson that persistently slipped his
memory.&nbsp; Well enough he knew it, and it puzzled him that he
should find it so hard to believe, and, mostly, so easy a
grief.&nbsp; As he woke in the morning the thought struck down
his spirits, and then, with an instant revulsion, he doubted it
was but the aftertaste of a dream.&nbsp; But there lay the empty
half of the bed they were wont to share, and the lesson began
again.&nbsp; He went about the house.&nbsp; Here was a sheet of
gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s list of trades, pinned to the wall, there
the unfinished case of moths for which the customer was
waiting.&nbsp; These, and the shelves, and the
breeding-boxes&mdash;all were as parts of the old man, impossible
to consider apart from his active, white-headed figure.&nbsp; In
some odd, hopeless way they seemed to suggest that it was all
right, and that gran&rsquo;dad was simply in the garden, or
upstairs, or in the backhouse, and presently would come in as
usual and put them all to their daily uses.&nbsp; And it was only
by dint of stern concentration of thought that Johnny forced on
himself the assurance that the old man would come among his cases
no more, nor ever again discuss with him the list of London
trades.&nbsp; Then the full conviction struck him sorely, like a
blow behind the neck: the heavy stroke of bereavement and the
sick fear of the world for his mother and sister, together.&nbsp;
But there&mdash;he was merely torturing himself.&nbsp; He took
refuge in a curious callousness, that he could call back very
easily <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>when he would.&nbsp; So the days went, but with each new
day the intermissions of full realisation grew longer: till plain
grief persisted in a leaden ache, rarely broken by a spell of
apathy.</p>
<p>His mother and his sister went about household duties
silently, not often apart.&nbsp; They were comforted in
companionship, it seemed, but solitude brought tears and
heartbreak.&nbsp; Nan May&rsquo;s London upbringing caused her
some thought of what her acquaintances there would have called a
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; funeral.&nbsp; But here the machinery of
such funerals must be brought from a distance, thus becoming
doubly expensive; and this being the case, cottagers made very
little emulation at such times, and a walking
funeral&mdash;perhaps at best a cab from the rank at Loughton
station&mdash;satisfied most.&nbsp; Moreover, the old man himself
had many a time preached strong disapproval of money wasted on
funerals; had, indeed, prophesied that if any costliness were
wasted on him, he would rise from his coffin and kick a
mute.&nbsp; So now that the time had come, a Theydon carpenter
made the coffin, and a cab from Loughton was the whole
show.&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s relations were not, and of Nan
May&rsquo;s most still alive were forgotten; for in the forest
cottage the little family had been secluded from such
connections, as by sundering seas.&nbsp; At first they had seemed
too near for correspondence, and then they had been found too far
for visiting.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac came to the funeral, <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>however; and
though in the beginning he seemed prepared for solemn
declamation, something in the sober grief at the cottage made him
unwontedly quiet.</p>
<p>It was a short coffin, accommodated under the cabman&rsquo;s
seat with no great protrusion at the ends; what there was being
covered decently with a black cloth.&nbsp; And the cab held the
mourners easily: Johnny and Bessy in their Sunday clothes, their
mother in hers (they had always been black since she was first a
widow) and Uncle Isaac in a creasy suit of lustrous black, oddly
bunched and wrinkled at the seams: the conventional Sunday suit
of his generation of artisans, folded carefully and long
preserved, and designed to be available alike for church and for
such funerals as might come to pass.</p>
<p>A brisk wind stirred the trees, and flung showers of fallen
leaves after the shabby old four-wheeler as it climbed the lanes
that led up to the little churchyard; where the sexton and his
odd man waited with planks and ropes by the new-dug grave.&nbsp;
It was a bright afternoon, but a fresh chill in the wind hinted
the coming of winter.&nbsp; A belated Red Admiral seemed to chase
the cab, fluttering this way or that, now by one window, now by
the other, and again away over the hedge-top.&nbsp; Nothing was
said.&nbsp; Now and again Johnny took his eyes from the open
window to look at his companions.&nbsp; His mother, opposite,
sat, pale and worn, with her hands <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>in her lap, and gazed blankly over
his head at the front window of the cab.&nbsp; She was commonly a
woman of healthy skin and colour, but now the skin seemed
coarser, and there was no colour but the pink about her red
eyelids.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac, next her, sat forward, and rubbed his
chin over and round the knob of his walking stick, a bamboo
topped with a &ldquo;Turk&rsquo;s head&rdquo; of tarred
cord.&nbsp; As for Bessy, sitting at the far end of his own seat,
Johnny saw nothing of her face for her handkerchief and the
crutch-handle.&nbsp; But she was very quiet, and he scarcely
thought she was crying.&nbsp; For himself, he was sad enough, in
a heavy way, but in no danger of tears; and he turned again, and
looked out of the window.</p>
<p>At last the cab stopped at the lych gate.&nbsp; Here Bob
Smallpiece unexpectedly appeared, to lend a hand with the
coffin.&nbsp; So that with the sexton, and the carpenter who was
the undertaker, Uncle Isaac, and the keeper, the cabman&rsquo;s
help was not wanted.&nbsp; The cabman lingered a moment, to shift
cloths and aprons, and to throw a glance or two after the little
company as it followed the clergyman, and then he hastened to
climb to his seat and drive after a young couple that he spied
walking in the main road; for they were strangers, and looked a
likely fare back to the station.</p>
<p>Johnny found church much as it was on Sunday, except that
to-day they sat near the front, and that he <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>was conscious
of a faint sense of family importance by reason of the special
service, and the coffin so conspicuously displayed.&nbsp; A few
neighbours&mdash;women mostly&mdash;were there, too; and when the
coffin was carried out to the grave, they grouped themselves a
little way off in the background, with Bob Smallpiece farther
back still.</p>
<p>From the grave&rsquo;s edge one looked down over the
country-side, green and hilly, and marked out in meadows by rows
of elms, with hedges at foot.&nbsp; The wind came up briskly and
set the dead leaves going again and again, chasing them among the
tombs and casting them into the new red grave.&nbsp; Bessy was
quiet no longer, but sobbed aloud, and Nan May took no more care
to dry her eyes.&nbsp; Johnny made an effort that brought him
near to choking, and then another; and then he fixed his
attention on the cows in a meadow below, counted them with
brimming eyes, and named them (for he knew them well) as
accurately as the distance would let him.&nbsp; He would scarce
trust himself to take a last look, with the others, at the coffin
below and its bright tin plate, but fell straightway to watching
a man mending thatch on a barn, and wondering that he wore
neither coat nor waistcoat in such a fresh wind.&nbsp; And so,
except for a stray tear or two, which nobody saw overflow from
the brimming eyes, he faced it out, and walked away with the
others under the curious gaze of the neighbours, who lined up by
the path.&nbsp; And Smallpiece went off in <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the opposite
direction with the carpenter, who carried back the pall folded
over his arm, like a cloak.</p>
<p>The four mourners walked back by the lanes, in silence.&nbsp;
Uncle Isaac bore the restraint with difficulty, and glanced
uneasily at Nan May&rsquo;s face from time to time, as though he
were watching an opportunity to expound his sentiments at
length.&nbsp; But Johnny saw nothing of this, for affliction was
upon him.&nbsp; Now that gran&rsquo;dad was passed away
indeed&mdash;was buried, and the clods were rising quickly over
him&mdash;now that even the coffin was gone from the cottage, and
would never be seen again&mdash;it seemed that he had never
understood before, and he awoke to the full bitterness of
things.&nbsp; More, his effort at restraint was spent, and in the
revulsion he found he could hold in no longer.&nbsp; He peeped
into the thickets by the lane-side as he went, questing for an
excuse to drop behind.&nbsp; Seeing no other, he stooped and
feigned to tie his bootlace; calling, in a voice that quavered
absurdly in trying to seem indifferent, &ldquo;Go on, mother,
I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; presently!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed among the bushes, flung himself on the grass, and
burst into a blind fury of tears, writhing as though under a
shower of stinging blows.&nbsp; He had meant to cry quietly, but
all was past control, and any might hear that chanced by.&nbsp;
He scarce knew whether the fit had endured for seconds, minutes,
or hours, when he was aware of his mother, sitting beside him and
pressing <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>his bursting head to her breast.&nbsp; Bessy was there
too, and his mother&rsquo;s arms were round both alike.</p>
<p>With that he grew quieter and quieter still.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
mustn&rsquo;t break down, Johnny boy&mdash;there&rsquo;s hard
struggles before us,&rdquo; his mother said, smoothing back his
hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; you must be very good to me, Johnny,
you&rsquo;re the man now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her, and brushed the last of his tears away.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, mother, I will,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He rose,
calmer, awake to new responsibilities, and felt a man
indeed.&nbsp; Nothing remained of his outbreak but a
chance-coming shudder in the breath, and, as he helped Bessy to
her feet, he saw, five yards off, among the bushes, Uncle Isaac,
under his very tall hat, gazing blankly at the group, and gently
rubbing the Turk&rsquo;s head on his stick among the loose grey
whiskers that bordered his large face.</p>
<h2><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nan May</span> rose another woman in the
morning; for there was work before her.&nbsp; The children
marvelled to see her so calm and so busy, so full of thought for
the business in hand, so little occupied with sorrowful
remembrance.&nbsp; The old man, prudent ever, had arranged years
since for what had now befallen.&nbsp; There was a simple little
will on a sheet of notepaper.&nbsp; There was a great and
complicated list, on odd scraps of paper, thickly beset with
additions, alterations, and crossings-out, of the
&ldquo;specimens&rdquo; hoarded in the cottage; with pencil notes
of values, each revised a dozen times, as the market
changed.&nbsp; There was a Post-Office Savings Bank deposit book,
with entries amounting to eight pounds ten, and a nomination form
whereby Nan May might withdraw the money.&nbsp; There was no
life-insurance, for the old man had surrendered it years ago, to
secure the few pounds he needed to make up the full price of the
cottage.</p>
<p>The will gave Nan May all there might be to take, and left her
to execute.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac, on the return to the cottage the
day before, had at length broken into <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>speech, and by devious approaches,
cunningly disguised and ostentatiously casual, had reached the
will.&nbsp; But he got little by his motion, for though his niece
told him the will&rsquo;s purport, she protested that till
to-morrow she should do nothing with it, nor did she even offer
to produce it.&nbsp; Of course, he had scarcely expected a legacy
himself; but still, he was Uncle Isaac, profound in experience,
learned in the law, and an oracle in the family.&nbsp; It seemed,
to say the least, a little scandalous that he should not have had
the handling of this property, the selling, the control, the
doling out, with such consideration the exertion might earn, and
the accidents of arithmetic detach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an important thing, is a will,&rdquo; said
Uncle Isaac sagely.&nbsp; &ldquo;A thing as ought to be seen to
by a experienced person.&nbsp; You might jist look an&rsquo; see
&rsquo;ow it&rsquo;s wrote.&nbsp; If any&rsquo;s wrote in pencil
it&rsquo;s nullavoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. May, without moving.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after a long pause: &ldquo;Lawyers comes very expensive
with wills,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;They come
expensive alwis, an&rsquo; mostly they rob the property
accordin&rsquo; to form o&rsquo; lawr.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s best to
get a man of experience, as you can trust, to go straight to
Somerset &rsquo;ouse in form o&rsquo; porpus . . .&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the cheapest way, an&rsquo; safe.&nbsp; &rsquo;E takes
the will, jist as it might be me, an&rsquo; &rsquo;e goes to the
&rsquo;thorities, an&rsquo; &rsquo;e talks to &rsquo;em,
knowin&rsquo; an&rsquo; <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>confidential.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere I am,
ses &rsquo;e, as it might be me, on be&rsquo;alf o&rsquo; the
last will an&rsquo; &rsquo;oly testament as it might be o&rsquo;
Mr. May.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve come in form o&rsquo; porpus,
&rsquo;avin&rsquo; objections to lawyers.&nbsp; In form o&rsquo;
porpus,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac repeated impressively, tapping a
forefinger on the table: as was his way of blazoning an erudite
phrase that else might pass unregarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor gran&rsquo;dad told me what to do about
goin&rsquo; to Somerset House, an&rsquo; all that,&rdquo;
answered Nan May, &ldquo;in case anything happened.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;d take it very kind if you&rsquo;d come with me, Uncle
Isaac, me not understandin&rsquo; such things.&nbsp; But I
can&rsquo;t think about it to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with so much
of his finger in the pie Uncle Isaac was fain to be
content.&nbsp; And soon he left, declining to stay for the
night&mdash;to Johnny&rsquo;s great relief&mdash;because his
cheap return-ticket was available for the day and no more.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And now Johnny, having brought sheets of foolscap paper from
Loughton, was set to work to make a fair copy of the amazing list
of specimens; a work at great length accomplished in an unstable
round hand, but on the whole with not so many blots.&nbsp; And
Nan May&rsquo;s series of visits to Somerset House was begun,
saddening her with a cost of one and ninepence each visit for
fares in train and omnibus.&nbsp; The first, indeed, cost more,
for Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s fare from Millwall was also to be
paid.&nbsp; <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>But he came no more, for in truth his failure as a man
of business was instant and ignoble.</p>
<p>To begin with, the shadow of the awful building fell on him as
he neared it, extinguishing his confidence and stopping his
tongue.&nbsp; In the quadrangle the very tall hat distinguished
an Uncle Isaac of hushed speech and meek docility, and along the
corridors it followed Nan May deferentially, in unresting pursuit
of room No. 37.&nbsp; The room was reached at last, and here
Uncle Isaac found himself constrained to open the business.&nbsp;
For Nan May herself held back now, and the young man in
gold-rimmed glasses fixed him with his eye.&nbsp; So, taking off
his hat with both hands, Uncle Isaac, in a humble murmur,
began:&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve&mdash;good mornin&rsquo;,
sir&mdash;we&rsquo;ve come as it might be in form o&rsquo;
porpus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As regards to a will,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac explained
desperately, dropping his technicality like a hot rivet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As regards to a will an&rsquo; dyin&rsquo; testament which
the late deceased did&mdash;did write out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Are you the executor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, not as it might be executor.&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
But as uncle to Mr. May&rsquo;s daughter-in-law by
marriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are <i>you</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; The gentleman turned
abruptly to Nan May, who gave him the will.&nbsp; Whereupon Uncle
Isaac, in a hopeful way of recovering nerve and eloquence, was
thrust out of the business, and told that Nan May alone <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>would be
dealt with.&nbsp; And he retired once more into shadow, with a
little relief to leaven a great deal of injured dignity.</p>
<p>So that for the rest Nan May relied on herself alone, and
hardened her face to the world.&nbsp; When the specimens came to
be sold, a smart young man came from the London firm of
naturalists, to make an offer.&nbsp; He examined the trays and
cases as hastily and carelessly as was consistent with a privily
sharp eye to all they held, and with the air of contempt proper
for a professional buyer.&nbsp; For in such a matter of business
the widow and the orphan needing money are the weak party, humble
and timid, watching small signs with sinking hearts, and easy to
beat: and a man of business worth the name of one, takes
advantage of the fact for every penny it will bring.&nbsp; So the
smart young man, looking more contemptuous than ever, and dusting
his fingers with his pocket-handkerchief, flung Nan May an offer
of five pounds for the lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank-you, sir,&rdquo; the woman answered with
simple decision.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve had
the trouble.&nbsp; Good-morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was not the
reply the young man had looked for, and indeed, not a reply easy
of rejoinder.&nbsp; So he was constrained to some unbending of
manner, and a hint that his firm might increase the offer if she
would name a sum.&nbsp; And the whole thing ended with a letter
carrying a cheque for forty pounds.&nbsp; Which was <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>very handsome
indeed, for the young man&rsquo;s firm would scarce have paid
more than eighty pounds for the collection In the ordinary way of
trade.</p>
<p>And so the old man&rsquo;s little affairs were gathered up,
and the Inland Revenue took its bite out of the estate, and there
were no more journeys to Somerset House.&nbsp; But nobody would
buy the cottage.</p>
<h2><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> such a day as Johnny&rsquo;s
London memories always brought, cold and dry and brisk, found him
perched on the cart that was to take him to London again.&nbsp;
Besides himself, the cart held his mother and his sister, and the
household furniture from the cottage; while Banks, the carrier,
sat on the shaft.&nbsp; Bessy was made comfortable in the
armchair; her mother sat on a bundle of bedding, whence it was
convenient to descend when steep hills were encountered; and
Johnny sat on the tail-board, and jumped off and on as the humour
took him.</p>
<p>All through long Loughton village there was something of a
triumphal progress, for people knew them, and turned to
look.&nbsp; Bessy alone remained in the cart for the long pull up
Buckhurst Hill, while Johnny, tramping beside and making many
excursions into the thicket, flung up into her lap sprigs of
holly with berries.&nbsp; Already they had plenty, packed close
in a box, but it is better to have too much than too little, so
any promising head was added to the store.&nbsp; For it was
December, and Christmas would come in three weeks or so.&nbsp;
And ere <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>that Nan May was to open shop in London.&nbsp; It was to
be a chandler&rsquo;s shop, with aspirations toward grocery and
butter: chandlery, grocery, and butter being things of the buying
and selling whereof Nan May knew as little as anybody in the
world, beyond the usual retail prices at the forest
villages.&nbsp; But something must be done, and everything has a
beginning somewhere.&nbsp; So Nan May resolutely set face to the
work, to play the world with all the rigour of the game; and her
figure, as she tramped sturdily up the hill beside the cart, was
visible symbol of her courage.&nbsp; Always a healthy,
clear-skinned, almost a handsome woman, active and shapely, she
walked the hill with something of steadfast fierceness, as one
joying in trampling an obstacle: her eyes fixed before her, and
taking no heed of the view that opened to Bessy&rsquo;s gaze as
she looked back from under the tilt of the cart; but busy with
thought of the fight she was beginning, a little fearful, but by
so much the gamer.&nbsp; Meanwhile, it was a good piece of
business to decorate a shop with holly at Christmas, and here
Johnny found holly ready for the work; it would cost money in
London.</p>
<p>The cart crowned the hill-top, and still Nan May regarded not
the show that lay behind, whereof Bessy took her fill for the
moments still left.&nbsp; There Loughton tumbled about its green
hills, beset with dusky trees, like a spilt boxful of toys, with
the sad-coloured forest making the horizon line behind it.&nbsp;
Away to the left, seen <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>between the boughs of the near pines,
High Beach steeple lifted from the velvety edge, and as far to
the right, on its own hill, rose the square church tower that
stood by gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; And where the bold
curve of Staples Hill lost itself among the woods, some tall
brown trees uprose above the rest and gave good-bye.&nbsp; For
invisible beyond them lay the empty cottage in its patch of
garden, grown dank and waste.&nbsp; Then roadside trees shut all
out, and the cart stopped on the level to take up Nan May.</p>
<p>And now the old mare jogged faster along to Woodford Wells and
through the Green, fringed with a wonder of big houses, and many
broad miles of country seen between them; then, farther, down the
easy slope of Rising Sun Road, with thick woods at the
way&rsquo;s edge on each side, their winter austerity softened by
the sunlight among the brown twigs.&nbsp; And so on and on, till
they emerged in bushy Leyton Flats, and turned off for
Leytonstone.</p>
<p>And now they were nearing London indeed.&nbsp; Once past the
Green Man, they were on a tram-lined road, and there were shops
and houses with scarce a break.&nbsp; Where there was one
bricklayers on scaffoldings were building shopfronts.&nbsp; The
new shops had a raw, disagreeable look, and some of these a
little older were just old enough to be dirty without being a
whit less disagreeable and raw.&nbsp; <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Some were prosperous, brilliant with
gilt and plate-glass; others, which had started even with them,
stood confessed failures, poor and mean, with a pathetic
air&mdash;almost an expression&mdash;of disappointment in every
window.&nbsp; Older buildings&mdash;some very old&mdash;stood
about Harrow Green, but already the wreckers had begun to pull a
cottage down to make room for something else.&nbsp; And then the
new shops began again, and lined the road without a check, till
they were new no longer, but of the uncertain age of commonplace
London brick and mortar; and Maryland Point Railway Station was
passed; and it was town indeed, with clatter and smoke and
mud.</p>
<p>Stratford Broadway lay wide and busy, wth the church and the
town-hall imposing and large.&nbsp; But soon the road narrowed
and grew fouler, and the mouths of unclean alleys dribbled slush
and dirty children across the pavement.&nbsp; Then there were
factories, and the road passed over narrow canals of curiously
iridescent sludge, too thick, to the casual eye, for the passage
of any craft, but interesting to the casual nose.&nbsp; And there
was a great, low, misty waste of the dullest possible rubbish,
where grass would not grow; a more hopelessly desolate and
dispiriting wilderness than Johnny had ever dreamed of or Bessy
ever read; with a chemical manure-works in a far corner, having a
smell of great volume and range.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>They
topped Bow Bridge, and turned sharply to the left.&nbsp; Now it
was London itself, London by Act of Parliament.&nbsp; There was a
narrow way with a few wharf gates, and then an open space, with
houses centuries old, fallen on leaner years, but still grubbily
picturesque.&nbsp; Hence the old mare trotted through a long and
winding street that led by dirty entries, by shops, by big
distilleries, by clean, dull houses where managers lived, by
wooden inns swinging ancient signs, over canal bridges: to a
place of many streets lying regularly at right angles, all of
small houses, all clean, every one a counterpart of every
other.&nbsp; And then&mdash;the docks and the ships.&nbsp; At
least, the great dock-gates, with the giant pepper-box and the
clock above them, and the high walls, with here and there a
mast.&nbsp; And at intervals, as the houses permitted, the high
walls and the masts were visible again and again in the short way
yet to go, pass Blackwall Cross, till at last the cart stopped
before a little shut-up shop, badly in want of paint; in a street
where one gained the house-doors down areas maybe, or up steps,
or on the level, from a pavement a little more than two feet
wide; while the doors themselves, and the wooden rails that
guarded all the steps, were painted in divers unaccustomed and
original colours, and had nothing in common but a subtle flavour
of ship&rsquo;s stores.&nbsp; Over the way was the wall of a
ship-yard.&nbsp; And wheresoever there might be a <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>view of
houses from the back, there were small flagstaffs rigged as
masts, with gaffs complete.</p>
<p>The door of the little shop opened, after a short struggle
with the rusty lock, and Nan May and her children were at home in
London.</p>
<h2><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shop in Harbour Lane had been a
greengrocer&rsquo;s, a barber&rsquo;s, a
fried-fishmonger&rsquo;s, and a tripe-seller&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But
chiefly it had been shut up, as it was now.&nbsp; Nobody had ever
come into it with much money, it is true, but all had gone out of
it with less than they brought.&nbsp; It was said, indeed, that
the greengrocer had gone out with nothing but the clothes he
wore; but as he went no farther than the end of the street, where
he drowned himself from a swing bridge, he needed no more, nor
even so much.&nbsp; Mr. Dunkin, the landlord, had bought the
place at a low price, as was his way in buying things; but he got
very little out of his investment, which was not his way at
all.&nbsp; It was a novelty that surprised and irritated Mr.
Dunkin.&nbsp; He was a substantial tradesman, who had long
relinquished counter work, for there were a dozen assistants in
the two departments of his chief shop, eight for grocery and
butter, and four for oil and saucepans, paint and mousetraps; and
there were half a dozen branches, some in the one trade and some
in the other, scattered about in as many neighbouring
parishes.&nbsp; He was a large man, of vast <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>sympathy.&nbsp; The tone of his voice, the grasp of his
wide, pulpy hand, told of infinite tenderness toward the sorrows
and sins of the world.&nbsp; Even in the early days when he had
but one shop (a little one) and no shopman, he would weigh out a
pound of treacle with so melting a benignity that the treacle
seemed balm of Gilead, and a bounteous gift at the price.&nbsp;
He would drive a bargain in a voice of yearning beneficence that
left the other party ashamed of his own self-seeking, as well as
something the poorer by the deal.&nbsp; It was a voice wherein a
purr had a large part&mdash;a purr that was hoarse yet soothing,
and eloquent of compassion; so that no man was so happy but a
talk with Mr. Dunkin would persuade him that the lot was hard
indeed, that entitled him to such a wealth of sympathy.&nbsp; It
was a wealth that Mr. Dunkin squandered with no restraint but
this, that it carried no other sort of wealth with it.</p>
<p>On the whole, Nan May had counted herself fortunate in falling
in with Mr. Dunkin.&nbsp; For when, in his fatherly solicitude,
he discovered that she had a little money in hand, he undertook
to supply her with stock, and to give her certain hints in the
mystery of chandlery.&nbsp; He, also, felt no cause for
complaint: for he had hoped for a tenant merely, and here was
tenant and customer in one.&nbsp; More, she was a widow, knowing
nothing of trade, so that it might be possible to sell her what
others would not buy, at a little extra profit.&nbsp; As to <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>rent,
moreover, he was doing well.&nbsp; For on the day the deposit was
paid, Mrs. May had found little choice among vacant shops, and
this was in a situation to suit her plans as to Johnny and his
trade; and as she was tired and nervous, full of plain anxiety,
sympathetic Mr. Dunkin saw his chance of trying for an extra
shilling a week, and got it.&nbsp; And Nan May was left to pay
for what painting and cleaning the place might need.&nbsp; It
needed a good deal, as Mr. Dunkin had ruefully observed two days
before, in expectation of a decorator&rsquo;s bill if ever a
tenant came.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And now Nan May addressed herself to the work.&nbsp; First,
the house must be cleaned; the paint could be considered
after.&nbsp; She had swept one room into a habitable state on her
last day in town, and here her little store of furniture was
stacked.&nbsp; Then, her sleeves and her skirt turned back, and a
duster over her head, she assailed walls and ceilings with a
broom, and after these the floors.&nbsp; So far Johnny helped,
but when scrubbing began he hindered.&nbsp; So it was that for a
day or so, until it was time for him to help with the windows, he
had leisure wherein to make himself acquainted with the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>It was a neighbourhood with a flavour distinct from that of
the districts about it.&nbsp; There the flat rows of six-roomed
cottages, characterless all, stretched <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>everywhere, rank behind rank, in
masses unbroken except by the busier thoroughfares of
shops.&nbsp; Here each little house asserted its individuality by
diversity of paint as much as by diversity of shape.&nbsp; It
was, indeed, the last stronghold of the shipwrights and
mast-makers, fallen from their high estate since the invasion of
iron ships and northern competition.&nbsp; In fact,
Shipwrights&rsquo; Row was the name of a short rank of cottages
close by, with gardens in front, each with its mast and flag
complete.&nbsp; In other places, where the back-yards were very
small, the flagstaff and stays were apt to take to their use the
whole space: the pole rising from the exact centre, and a stay
taking its purchase from each extreme corner, so that anybody
essaying a circuit must perform it with many sudden
obeisances.&nbsp; The little streets had an air of cleanliness
all their own, largely due to the fresh paint that embellished
whatsoever there was an excuse for painting.&nbsp; Many
front-doors were reached by two stone steps, always well
whitened; and whether there were steps or not, the flagstones
before each threshold were distinguished by a whited semicircle
five feet in diameter.&nbsp; Noting this curious fact as he
tramped along one such street, Johnny was startled by an angry
voice close at his elbow, a voice so very sudden and irate that
he jumped aside ere he looked for the source.&nbsp; A red-faced
woman knelt within a door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idle young faggit!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stompin&rsquo; yer muddy <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>boots all over my clean
step!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she made so vigorous a grasp at a broom
that Johnny went five yards at a gallop.</p>
<p>Now truly there was no step of any sort to the house.&nbsp;
And Johnny had but crossed the semicircle because he conceived
the footpath to be public property, and because it was
narrow.&nbsp; But he learnt, afterwards, that the semicircle was
a sacred institution of the place, in as high regard among the
women as its fellow-fetish, the flagstaff, was among the men;
also that none but grown people&mdash;and those of low habits or
in drink&mdash;dared trespass on it; and that it was always
called &ldquo;the step.&rdquo;&nbsp; He learnt much, too, in the
matter of paint.&nbsp; Every male inhabitant of Harbour Lane,
Shipwrights&rsquo; Row, and the neighbouring streets, carried, in
his leisure moments, a pipe, a pot of paint, and a brush.&nbsp;
He puffed comfortably at the pipe, and stumped about his back (or
front) garden with the paint-pot in one hand and the brush in the
other, &ldquo;touching-up&rdquo; whatever paint would stick
to.&nbsp; Rails, posts, water-butts, dustbins, clothes-posts, all
were treated, not because they needed it (for they were scarce
dry from the last coat), but because there was the paint, and
there was the brush, and there was the leisure; and this was the
only way to use all three.&nbsp; So that most things about the
gardens took an interesting variety of tints in the run of the
year, since it was rarely the case that the same <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>colour was
used twice in succession.&nbsp; When all wooden surfaces were
covered, it was customary to take a turn at window-sills,
rain-water pipes, and the stones or oyster-shells that bordered
the little flower-beds; and when nothing else was left, then the
paint-pot and the brush and the pipe were conveyed to the front,
and the front-door, which had been green, became royal blue, or
flaming salmon; as did the railings, if there were any, and the
window-frames.&nbsp; Two things alone were not subject to such
changes of complexion: the flagstaff and the brick pavings.&nbsp;
For it was a law immutable that the flagstaffs should be
speckless white, and the bricks a cheerful vermilion; this last a
colour frequently renewed, because of nailed boots, but done in
good oil paint, because of wet weather.&nbsp; Everything else
took the range of the rainbow, and something beyond; so that it
was possible, in those houses where two families lived, to tell
at a glance whether the upstairs family were on terms of intimacy
or merely of distant civility with the downstairs, by the
colours, uniform or diverse, of the sills and the model fences
that guarded the flower-pots on them.&nbsp; For the token and
sign of friendship in Harbour Lane was the loan or the exchange
of paint.&nbsp; It was the proper method of breaking the ice
between new acquaintances, and was recognised as such by general
sanction.&nbsp; The greeting, &ldquo;Bit o&rsquo; blue paint any
use to ye?&rdquo; and the offer of the pot across the <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>back fence,
were the Harbour Lane equivalents of a call and cards; and the
newcomer made early haste with an offer of yellow or green paint
in return.&nbsp; Indeed, it was in this way that the paint
arrived which afterwards made Nan May&rsquo;s little shop a
bedazzlement to the wayfarer, and furnished Johnny with the first
painting job he ever grew tired of.&nbsp; But newcomers were rare
in the neighbourhood, for it was a colony apart, with independent
manners and habits of thought.&nbsp; True, it had its own
divisions and differences: as, for instance, on the question
whether or not the association of the paint-pot and brush with
the Sunday paper were sinful; but these divisions were purely
internal, and nothing was heard of them beyond the
boundaries.</p>
<p>But paint was something more than a recreation and an
instrument of social amenity.&nbsp; It furnished the colony with
an equivalent of high finance, wherein all the operations proper
to Money and Credit (as spelt with capital initials) were
reflected in Paint.&nbsp; For it was a permanent condition of
life in Harbour Lane and thereabouts, that everybody owed
everybody else some amount of Paint, and was owed Paint, in his
turn, by others.&nbsp; So that a complicated system of exchange
prevailed, in which verbal bills and cheques were drawn.&nbsp; As
thus, to make a simple case:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Bill, what about that pot o&rsquo;
paint?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;Well, I was goin&rsquo; to bring it round
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t bring it to
me&mdash;take it to George.&nbsp; Ye see, I owe Jim a bit
o&rsquo; paint, an&rsquo; &rsquo;e owes Joe a bit, an&rsquo; Joe
owes George a bit.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;ll make it right all
round.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many such arrangements synchronising, crossing and mixing
with each other, and made intricate by differing degrees and
manners of debit and credit between Bill and George and Jim and
Joe, the unlikely subject of Paint became involved in a
mathematical web of exceeding interest, a small image of the
Money Market, a sort of chaos by double entry wherein few
operators were able to strike a balance at a moment, and most
were vaguely uncertain whether their accounts inclined toward an
affluence of Paint or toward sheer bankruptcy.&nbsp; An exciting
result attained without the aid of capital, and with no serious
hurt to anybody.</p>
<p>But these were things that Johnny learned in the succeeding
weeks.&nbsp; In his walks while his mother scrubbed floors at
home, he observed one or two matters.&nbsp; As to costume, he
perceived that the men wore blue dungaree jackets with large bone
buttons, and outside these, now that it was winter, short pilot
coats of dark blue stuff, thick and stiff, like a board.&nbsp;
The trousers were moleskins, perhaps once white, all stained with
very shiny black patches, and all of one cut, which placed the
seat (very baggy) a few inches above the <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>bend of the
knee; and there was a peaked cap, of the same shiny black all
over that distinguished parts of the trousers.&nbsp; He also saw
that whereas yesterday the backyards were brisk with fluttering
linen, to-day they held scarce any.&nbsp; For yesterday was
Monday, and it was matter of pride among the energetic housewives
of the place to get washing done at the beginning of the
week.&nbsp; For a woman fell in her neighbours&rsquo; respect the
later in the week her washing day came.</p>
<p>So Johnny explored the streets with wide eyes and a full
heart.&nbsp; For here was London, where they made great
things&mdash;ships and engines.&nbsp; There were places he
fancied he recognised&mdash;great blank walls with masts behind
them.&nbsp; But now the masts seemed fewer and shorter than in
the old days: as in truth they were, for now more of the ships
were steamships, filling greater space for half the show of
mast.&nbsp; Then in other places he came on basins filled with
none but sailing-ships, and here the masts were as tall and fine
as ever, stayed with much cordage, and had their yards slung at a
gallant slope, like the sword on Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s
hip.&nbsp; And at Blackwall Stairs, looking across the river,
stood an old, old house that Johnny stared at for minutes
together: a month or two later he heard the tradition that Sir
Walter Raleigh himself had lived there.&nbsp; It was first of a
row of old waterside buildings, the newest of which had looked
across, and almost fallen into, the <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>river, when King George&rsquo;s ships
had anchored off Blackwall&mdash;and King Charles&rsquo;s for
that matter.&nbsp; There, too, stood the Artichoke Tavern, clean
and white and wooden, a heap of gables and windows all out of
perpendicular: a house widest and biggest everywhere at the top,
and smallest at the ground floor; a house that seemed ready to
topple into the river at a push, so far did its walls and
galleries overhang the water, and so slender were the piles that
supported them.&nbsp; Here, in the square space on the quay,
brown men in blue jerseys sold bloaters by the score, stringing
them through the gills with tarry yarn; and half the brown men
wore earrings.&nbsp; Below, on the foreshore, lay many boats, and
children ran among them, or raked for river-mussels among the
stones.</p>
<p>In another place he came on just such market-streets as he
remembered to have trotted along, at his mother&rsquo;s side, in
the old London life; though now, indeed, they seemed something
dirtier and meaner, and the people seemed less cheerful.&nbsp;
But this was a place away from Harbour Lane&mdash;a neighbourhood
of dull and dingy rows of little houses, range on range.&nbsp;
And still farther he found another street of shops, or rather
half a street, for one side was a blank wall.&nbsp; But no great
skeleton ship lifted its ribs above the bricks, and no hammers
clanged behind them; for it was a ship-yard abandoned, and a
painted board, thick with grime, offered the place <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>for sale or
hire.&nbsp; Some of the shops opposite were abandoned too, and
the others were poor and dull.&nbsp; Johnny walked a few steps
backward, looking at the shops, and when he turned about at a
corner, he almost scorched himself at a coke fire where chestnuts
were roasting; and there behind the fire stood the pockmarked man
himself, not a whit altered!&nbsp; There he stood, with his hands
deep in his pockets, and tapped the kerb with his clogged boots,
just as he had stood when the great ship was making, and the
lights flared round it, and the shops were all open and busy:
perhaps the pitted face was a trifle paler, but that was all.</p>
<p>But Harbour Lane and thereabout were the most interesting
parts, and the pleasantest for Johnny.&nbsp; Just beyond the
Stairs, and the old houses, and the Artichoke Tavern, was a
dock-inlet, with an extraordinary bridge that halved in the
middle, and swung back to each of two quays, to let ships
through.&nbsp; Men worked it quite easily, with a winch, and
Johnny could have watched for an hour.&nbsp; But just here he
caught sight of an acquaintance.&nbsp; For down on the quay below
the bridge-end, sitting on a mooring-post, was Mr. Butson.&nbsp;
A trifle seedy and fallen in condition, Johnny fancied, and
grumly ill-used as ever.&nbsp; As Johnny looked, Mr. Butson took
a pipe from his pocket, and a screw of paper.&nbsp; The paper
yielded nothing.&nbsp; Mr. Butson raked through <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>both
jacket-pockets, and scowled at his empty hands.&nbsp; In the end,
after a gloomy inspection of the pipe, he put it away and
returned to savage meditation.&nbsp; And Johnny went home.</p>
<h2><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at Maidment and
Hurst&rsquo;s, engineers, that Johnny&rsquo;s father had met his
death; and it was to Maidment and Hurst that Nan had resolved to
take the boy, and beg an apprenticeship for him.&nbsp; True, the
firm had at the time done more than might have been expected of
it, for the accident had been largely a matter of heedlessness on
the victim&rsquo;s part, and the victim was no old hand, but had
taken his job only a few months before.&nbsp; It had seen that
nothing was lacking for the widow&rsquo;s immediate needs, nor
for a decent funeral; and it had offered to find places in an
orphanage for the children.&nbsp; But Nan May could not bring
herself to part with them: Bessie, indeed, was barely out of the
hospital at the time.&nbsp; And then the lonely old
butterfly-hunter had cut matters short by carrying them off all
three.</p>
<p>So that now, if Johnny were to learn a trade, Maidment and
Hurst&rsquo;s was his best chance, for it was just possible that
the firm would take him apprentice without premium, when it was
reminded of his father.&nbsp; In this thing Nan May wasted no
time.&nbsp; The house once clean within, and something done
toward stocking the shop, <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Johnny was made ready, in the best of
his clothes, for inspection.&nbsp; It was a muddy morning, and
Mrs. May had fears for the polish on Johnny&rsquo;s boots.&nbsp;
Gladly would she have carried him across the miry streets, as she
had done in the London of years ago, though she knew better than
to hint at such an outrage on his dignity.&nbsp; So they walked
warily, dodging puddles with mutual warnings, and fleeing the
splashes of passing vans.&nbsp; Truly London was changed, even
more in Nan May&rsquo;s eyes than in Johnny&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
people seemed greyer, more anxious, worse fed, than when she
lived among them before, a young wife in a smiling world, with
the best part of thirty-eight shillings to spend every
week.&nbsp; The shops were worse stocked, and many that she
remembered well were shut.&nbsp; True, some flourished signs of
prosperity, but to her it seemed prosperity of a different and a
paltrier sort&mdash;vulgar and trumpery.&nbsp; Once out of the
Harbour Lane district, the little houses lacked the snug,
geranium-decked, wire-blinded, rep-curtained comfort of aspect
she remembered so well&mdash;the air that suggested a red fire
within, a shining copper kettle, a high fender, and muffins on a
trivet.&nbsp; Things were cheap, and cold, and grubby.&nbsp;
Above all, the silent ship-yards oppressed her fancies.&nbsp;
Truly, this looked an ill place for new trade!&nbsp; In her hunt
for the vacant shop she had encountered no old friends, and now,
though she walked through familiar streets, she had little but
fancied <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>recognition, now and again, of some face at a shop
door.</p>
<p>Presently they turned a corner and came upon a joyful crowd of
boys.&nbsp; They ran, they yelled, they flung, and in their midst
cursed and floundered a rusty rag of a woman, drunk and
infuriate, harried, battered and bedeviled.&nbsp; Her clothes
were of decent black, but dusty and neglected, and one side of
her skirt dripped with fresh mud.&nbsp; Her hair was draggled
about her shoulders, and her bonnet hung in it, a bunch of
mangled crape, while she staggered hither and thither, making
futile swipes at the nimble rascals about her.&nbsp; She struck
out feebly with a little parcel of bacon-rashers rolled in a
paper, and already a rasher had escaped, to be flung at her head,
and flung again by the hand that could first snatch it from the
gutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&nbsp; Old Mother Born-drunk!&rdquo; shouted the
young savages, and two swooped again with the stretched
skipping-rope that had already tripped their victim twice.&nbsp;
But she clasped a post with both arms, and cursed at large,
hoarse and impotent.</p>
<p>Nan May started and stood, and then hurried on.&nbsp; For she
had recognised a face at last, grimed and bloated though it had
grown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Law!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Emma
Pacey!&nbsp; To think&mdash;to think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed the shock was great, and the change amazing.&nbsp; It
was a change that would have baffled recognition by <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>an eye that
had less closely noted the Emma Pacey of seventeen years
ago.&nbsp; But Emma Pacey was a smart girl then (though fast and
forward, Nan May had always said), and had caused some little
disturbance in a course of true love which led, nevertheless, to
Nan&rsquo;s wedding after all.&nbsp; In such circumstances a
woman views her rival&rsquo;s face, as she views her clothes,
with a searching eye, and remembers well.&nbsp; &ldquo;And to
come to that!&rdquo; mused Nan May, perplexed at a shade of
emotion that seemed ill-turned to the occasion, wherein the
simple soul saw nothing of womanish triumph.</p>
<p>But the changes seemed not all for the worse.&nbsp; There were
busy factories, and some that had been small were now
large.&nbsp; Coffee-stalls, too, were set up in two or three
places, where no such accommodation was in the old time: always a
sign of increasing trade.&nbsp; But on the whole the walk did
nothing to raise Nan&rsquo;s spirits.</p>
<p>Johnny saw little.&nbsp; The excursion was to decide whether
he should learn to make steam-engines or not, though what manner
of adventure he was to encounter he figured but vaguely.&nbsp; He
was to come into presence of some gentlemen,
presumably&mdash;gentlemen who would settle his whole destiny
off-hand, on a cursory examination of his appearance and
manner.&nbsp; He must be alert to show his best behaviour, though
what things the gentlemen might do or say, and what unforeseen
problems of conduct might present themselves, were past guessing;
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>though he
guessed and guessed, oblivious of present circumstance.&nbsp;
Only once before had he felt quite that quality of trepidation,
and that was three years back, when he trudged along the road to
Woodford to get a tooth drawn.</p>
<p>But he came off very well, though the preliminaries were
solemn&mdash;rather more portentous, he thought, than anything in
the dentist&rsquo;s waiting-room.&nbsp; There was a sort of
counter, with bright brass rails, and a ground-glass box with an
office-boy inside it.&nbsp; The unprecedented and unbusinesslike
apparition of Mrs. May, with a timid request to see Mr. Maidment
or Mr. Hurst (one was dead, and the other never came near the
place), wholly demoralised the office-boy, who retired upon his
supports in the depths of the office.&nbsp; Thence there
presently emerged a junior clerk, who, after certain questions,
undertook to see if the acting partner were in.&nbsp; Then came a
time of stealthy and distrustful inspection on the part of the
office-boy, who, having regained his box, and gathered up his
wits, began to suspect Johnny of designs on his situation.&nbsp;
But at last Johnny and his mother were shown into an inner room,
furnished with expensive austerity, where a gentleman of thirty
or thirty-five (himself expensively austere of mien) sat at a
writing-table.&nbsp; The gentleman asked Mrs. May one or two
rather abrupt questions about her dead husband&mdash;dates, and
so forth&mdash;and referred to certain notes on his table after
each <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>answer.&nbsp; Then Nan offered him one of three papers
which she had been fiddling in her hand since first she passed
the street door&mdash;her marriage &ldquo;lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, ah, yes&mdash;yes&mdash;of course,&rdquo; said the
gentleman with some change of manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course.&nbsp; Quite right.&nbsp; Best to make
sure&mdash;can&rsquo;t remember everybody.&nbsp; Sit down, Mrs.
May.&nbsp; Come here, my boy.&nbsp; So you want to be an
engineer, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, if you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; He never thought
it would be quite so hard to get it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&nbsp; Plenty of hard work, you know.&nbsp; Not
afraid of that, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen next month, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on all right at school?&nbsp; What
standard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passed seventh, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. May handed over her other two papers: a
&ldquo;character&rdquo; from the schoolmaster and another from
the rector.</p>
<p>When the gentleman had read them, &ldquo;Yes, yes, very
good&mdash;very good, indeed,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;ve not finished learning yet, you know, my boy, if
you&rsquo;re to be an engineer.&nbsp; Fond of drawing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nan May chimed in: &ldquo;O, yes, sir, very
fond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you stick well at your drawing in the <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>evenings, and
learn the theory, you&rsquo;ll be a foreman some
day&mdash;perhaps a manager.&nbsp; It all depends on
yourself.&nbsp; You shall have a chance to show us what
you&rsquo;re made of.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all we can do&mdash;the
rest is for yourself, as I&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, thank-you, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
try.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. May was audibly thankful too, and
confident of Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, it&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
gentleman rang a bell, and bade the junior clerk &ldquo;Just send
for Cottam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent for the foreman,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;whose shop you will be in.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll look after
you as long as you behave well and keep up to your work.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t see me very often, but I shall know all about
you, remember.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned to his table, and
wrote.</p>
<p>Presently there was a sudden thump at the door, which opened
slowly and admitted the foremost part&mdash;it was the
abdomen&mdash;of Cottam the foreman.&nbsp; He was of middle
height, though he seemed short by reason of his corpulence;
deliberate in all his movements, yet hard, muscular, and
active.&nbsp; He turned, as it were on his own axis, at the edge
of the door, shut it with one hand, while he dangled a marine
peaked cap in the other; and looked, with serene composure, from
over his scrub of grey beard, first at Mrs. May, then at Johnny,
and last at his employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cottam,&rdquo; the gentleman said, writing one more
word, and letting drop his pen, &ldquo;this lad&rsquo;s name is
John <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>May.&nbsp; I expect you&rsquo;ll remember his
father.&nbsp; Bad accident, I believe, in the heavy turning shop;
died, in fact.&rdquo;&nbsp; This with a slight glance at Nan
May.</p>
<p>The foreman turned&mdash;turned his whole person, for his head
was set on his vast shoulders with no visible neck
between&mdash;bent a trifle, and inspected Johnny as he would
have inspected some wholly novel and revolutionary piece of
machinery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Y-u-u-us,&rdquo; he said, with a slowly
rising inflection, expressive of cautious toleration, as of one
reserving a definite opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Y-u-u-us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s to come on as apprentice, and
I&rsquo;d like him to come into your shop.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll
be no difficulty about that, will there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-o-o-o!&rdquo; with the same deliberate inflection,
similarly expressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better take him down, and tell the
timekeeper.&nbsp; He may as well begin on Monday, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-u-u-us!&rdquo; tuned once more in an ascending
scale.&nbsp; And with that the acting partner bade Mrs. May
good-morning, turned to his writing, and the business was
over.</p>
<p>Cottam the foreman put his cap on his head and led the way
through the outer office, along a corridor, down the stairs and
across the yard, with no indecent haste.&nbsp; It was a good
distance to go, and Johnny was vaguely reminded of a circus
procession that had once <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>passed through Loughton, and that he
had followed up for nearly three miles, behind the elephant.</p>
<p>Half-way across the yard the foreman stopped, and made a half
turn, so as to face Nan May as she came up.&nbsp; He raised an
immense leathery fist, and jerked a commensurate thumb over his
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the young
guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse whisper, with a
confidential twitch of one cheek that was almost a wink.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the young guv&rsquo;nor, that is.&nbsp; Smart
young chap.&nbsp; Knowed &rsquo;im so &rsquo;igh.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
brought down his hand to the level of his lowest waistcoat
button, twitched his cheek again, nodded, and walked on.</p>
<p>The timekeeper inhabited a little wooden cabin just within the
gates, and looked out of a pigeon-hole at all comers.&nbsp; Mr.
Cottam put his head into this hole&mdash;a close fit&mdash;and
when he withdrew it, the timekeeper, a grey man, came out of his
side door and stared hard at Johnny.&nbsp; Then he growled
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and went in again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock o&rsquo; Monday mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Mr. Cottam pronounced conclusively, addressing Mrs. May.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock o&rsquo; Monday mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
<i>&rsquo;Ere</i>,&rdquo; with a downward jerk of his thumb to
make it plain that somewhere else would not do.&nbsp; Then,
without a glance at Johnny, whom he had disregarded since they
left the office, he turned and walked off.&nbsp; Johnny and his
mother were opening the small door that was cut in the great
gate, when Mr. <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Cottam stopped and turned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he roared, and went on.</p>
<p>Mother and boy went their way joyously.&nbsp; Here was one of
Nan May&rsquo;s troubles dissolved in air, and as for Johnny, a
world of wonders was before him.&nbsp; Now he would understand
how steam made engines go, and all day he would see them
going&mdash;he would make engines himself, in fact.&nbsp; And for
this delightful pursuit he would be paid.&nbsp; Six shillings a
week was what apprentices got in their first year&mdash;a
shilling for every day of work.&nbsp; Next year he would get
eight shillings, and then ten, and so on.&nbsp; And at twenty-one
he would be a man indeed, an engineer like his father before
him.&nbsp; More, he was to draw.&nbsp; The gentleman had told him
to draw in his spare time.&nbsp; The clang of hammers was as a
merry peal from the works that lined their way, and the hoots of
steamships on the river made them a moving music.</p>
<p>Nan May wondered to see such merry faces about the streets on
the way home.&nbsp; Truly the place was changed; but, perhaps,
after all, it was no such bad place, even now.&nbsp; The street
was quiet where they had seen the drunken woman, though two very
small boys were still kicking a filthy slice of bacon about the
gutter.&nbsp; But three streets beyond they saw her for a
moment.&nbsp; For the blackguard boys had contrived to topple
Mother Born-drunk into a hand-barrow, which they were now <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>trundling
along at such a pace that the bedraggled sufferer could do no
more than lie and cling to the rails, a gasping, uncleanly
heap.&nbsp; Truly Emma Pacey&rsquo;s punishment was upon her.</p>
<p>Bessy brightened wonderfully at the news of Johnny&rsquo;s
success.&nbsp; For she was thoughtful and
&ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo; even among the prematurely sage
girl-children of her class, and she had been fretting
silently.&nbsp; Now she hopped about with something of her old
activity.&nbsp; She reported that the next-door neighbour on the
left had been persistently peeping over the wall, and that just
before their arrival the peep had been accompanied by a very
artificial cough, meant to attract attention.&nbsp; So Mrs. May
went into the back-yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, mum,&rdquo; said the next-door
neighbour, a very red-faced man in a dungaree jacket.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Weather&rsquo;s cleared up a bit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve bin
&rsquo;avin&rsquo; &rsquo;alf a day auf, touchin&rsquo; up
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sank with a bob behind the wall, and rose
again with a paint-pot in his lifted hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bit
o&rsquo; red paint any use to ye?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>XI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> red paint-pot, and a blue one
from the same quarter, together with a yellow one from the
neighbours on the other side, a white one from an old lighterman
in the house behind, and a suitable collection of brushes
subscribed by all three, were Johnny&rsquo;s constant companions
till the end of that weary week.&nbsp; The shop-shutters grew to
be red, with a blue border.&nbsp; The window-frames were yellow,
the wall beneath was white, so was the cornice above; and the
door and the door-posts were red altogether, because the red
paint went farthest, and the red pot had been fullest to begin
with.&nbsp; Not only did the length of the job work off
Johnny&rsquo;s first enthusiasm, but its publicity embarrassed
him.&nbsp; Perched conspicuously on a step-ladder, painting a
shop in such stirring colours as these, he was the cynosure of
all wayfaring folk, the target of whatever jibes their wits might
compass.&nbsp; Three out of four warned him that the paint was
laid on wrong side out.&nbsp; Some, in unkindly allusion to
certain chance splashes, reminded him that he hadn&rsquo;t half
painted the window-panes; and facetious boys, in piteous
pantomime, affected to be reduced to instant <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>blindness by
sudden knowledge of Johnny&rsquo;s brilliant performance.&nbsp;
But he was most discomforted by those who merely stood and
stared, invisible behind him.&nbsp; If only he could have seen
them it would not have been so bad; the oppressive consciousness
that some contemptuous grown man behind and below&mdash;possibly
a painter by trade&mdash;was narrowly observing every stroke of
the brush, shook his nerve and enfeebled his execution.&nbsp;
Most of these earnest spectators seemed to have no pressing
business of their own, and their inspections were
prolonged.&nbsp; One critic found speech to remark, as he turned
to go his way: &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> makin&rsquo; a
bloomin&rsquo; mess up there!&rdquo;&nbsp; But most, as if at a
loss for words by mere amazement, sheered off with: &ldquo;Well,
blimy!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was discouraging to find that all these
people could have done it so much better, and, long before the
job was finished, Johnny was sore depressed and very humble, as
well as tired.&nbsp; Only one of all his witnesses offered help,
and he was a surprising person: very tall, very thin, and very
sooty from work; with splay feet, sloping shoulders, a long face
of exceeding diffidence, and long arms, which seemed to swing and
flap irresponsibly with the skirts of his long overcoat, and to
be a subject of mute apology.&nbsp; He saw Johnny tip-toeing at
the very top of the steps, making a bad shift to reach the
cornice.&nbsp; He stopped, looked about him, and then went on a
step or two; stopped again, and came back, with a timorous <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>glance at
the shop window; and when Johnny turned and looked, he said, in a
voice scarce above a whisper: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;tcher reach
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when Johnny
descended, the long man, with one more glance about the street,
went up three steps at a time and laid the paint on rapidly, many
feet at a sweep.&nbsp; He came down and shifted the steps very
easily with one hand&mdash;and they were heavy steps&mdash;went
up again, and in three minutes carried the paint to the very end
of the cornice.&nbsp; Then he came down, with a sheepish smile at
Johnny&rsquo;s thanks, and shambled as far as next door, where he
let himself in with a latch-key.&nbsp; And on Friday, at
dinner-time, perceiving Johnny&rsquo;s progress from his window
on the upper floor&mdash;he was a lodger, it seemed&mdash;he came
stealthily down and gave the cornice another coat.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On Saturday morning the shop was opened in form, though
Johnny&rsquo;s painting was not finished till dusk.&nbsp; Very
little happened.&nbsp; A few children stopped on their way, and
stared in at the door.&nbsp; The first customer was a boy from
among these, who came in to beg a piece of string; and infested
Harbour Lane for the rest of the day, swinging a dead rat on the
end of it.&nbsp; Hours passed, and Nan May&rsquo;s spirits fell
steadily.&nbsp; A few pounds, a very few&mdash;they could scarce
be made to last <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>three weeks&mdash;was all her reserve, and most of her
scanty stock was perishable.&nbsp; If it spoiled it could never
be replaced, and unless people bought it, spoil it must.&nbsp;
What more could she do?&nbsp; Industry, determination, and all
the rest were well enough, but when all was said and done,
nothing could make people come and buy.</p>
<p>Near noon the second customer came&mdash;a little girl this
time.&nbsp; She wanted a bottle of ink for a halfpenny.&nbsp;
There were half-a dozen little bottles of ink in a row in the
window; but the price was a penny, so the little girl went
away.&nbsp; It was a dull dinner that day.&nbsp; Bessy invented
ingenious conjectures to account for the lack of trade, and
prophesied a change in the afternoon, or the evening, or perhaps
next week, or at latest the week after.&nbsp; Her mother could
not understand.&nbsp; Customers came to other shops; why not to
this one?</p>
<p>She had seen nothing of Uncle Isaac since she had come to
Harbour Lane, though he knew where to find her.&nbsp; She had
hoped he would lend a hand with the painting, or with the display
of the stock; but no doubt he had been too busy.&nbsp; True,
Johnny thought he had seen him once from the steps, some way down
the street, but that must have been a mistake; for Uncle Isaac
would not have come so near them without calling, nor would he
have bolted instantly round the nearest <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>corner at
sight of the boy and his work, as Johnny had fancied he had.</p>
<p>The afternoon began no better than the morning.&nbsp; Nobody
came but a child, who asked for sixpenn&rsquo;orth of coppers,
till about four.&nbsp; Then a hurried woman demanded a
penn&rsquo;orth of mixed pickles in a saucer, and grumbled at the
quantity.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t come into the shop again, at
anyrate; a threat so discomposing (for was not the woman the
first paying customer?) that for hours Nan May could not forgive
herself for her illiberality; though indeed she gained but a weak
fraction of a farthing by the transaction.</p>
<p>Half an hour more went, and then there came a truly noble
customer.&nbsp; He looked like a bricklayer, and he was far from
sober: so far, indeed, that Johnny, on the steps, spying the mazy
sinuosity of his approach, got a step lower and made ready to
jump, in case of accidents.&nbsp; But the bricklayer, conscious
of the presence of many ladders, steered wide into the roadway,
and there stopped, fascinated by the brilliancy before him.&nbsp;
Some swaying moments of consideration resolved him that this was
a shop: and after many steps up the curb, and as many back in the
gutter, he picked a labyrinthine path among the myriad ladders,
narrowly missing the real one as he went, shouldered against the
wet door-post, and stumbled toward the counter.&nbsp; Here he
regarded a <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>bladder of lard with thoughtful severity, till Nan May
timorously asked what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shumm for kidsh,&rdquo; he replied sternly, to the
lard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shummforkidsh.&rdquo;&nbsp; For some moments
his scowl deepened; then he raised his hand and pointed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;W&mdash;wha&rsquo;sha&rsquo;?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tharr&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;&nbsp; He plunged his hand
into his trousers pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tharr&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ow mush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sevenpence halfpenny a pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orrigh&rsquo;?&nbsp; Gi&rsquo;s
&rsquo;oldovit.&rdquo;&nbsp; He reached an unsteady hand,
imperilling bottles; but Nan May was quicker, and took the
bladder of lard from its perch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow much?&nbsp; Thash wha&rsquo; <i>I</i>
wan&rsquo; know.&nbsp; You give it &rsquo;ere, go
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice rose disputatively, and he fell on the
bladder of lard with both hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow
mush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan reflected that it weighed more than three pounds, and that
she had paid Mr. Dunkin eighteenpence for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two
shillings,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two shillin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Orrigh&rsquo;,&rdquo; and
instantly what remained of the new customer&rsquo;s week&rsquo;s
wages was scattered about the counter.&nbsp; Mrs. May took two
shillings and returned the rest; which with some difficulty was
thrust back into the pocket.&nbsp; And the new customer, after
looking narrowly about him in search of his purchase, and at last
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>discovering it under his arm, sallied forth with a wipe
against the other door-post, and continued his winding way: a
solemn and portentous bricklayer, with red paint on his shoulders
and whiskers, and a bladder of lard that slipped sometimes
forward and sometimes backward from his embrace, and was a deal
of trouble to pick up again.</p>
<p>Here was a profit of sixpence at a stroke, unlikely as the
chance was to recur; and it raised Nan&rsquo;s spirits,
unreasonably enough.&nbsp; Still, the bricklayer brought luck of
a sort.&nbsp; For there were three more customers within the next
hour, two bringing a halfpenny and one a penny.&nbsp; And in the
evening five or six came, one spending as much as
fourpence.&nbsp; This was better, perhaps, but poor enough.&nbsp;
At ten that night Nan May reckoned her profit for the day at
ninepence farthing, including the bricklayer&rsquo;s sixpence;
and she was sick with waiting and faint with fear.&nbsp; At
half-past ten Uncle Isaac turned up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah hum,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;bin
paintin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Might &rsquo;a&rsquo; laid it on a bit
evener.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s right ways o&rsquo; layin&rsquo; on
paint, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s wrong ways, an&rsquo; one way
ain&rsquo;t the same as the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; He raised his
finger at Johnny instructively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Far from it and
contrairy, there&rsquo;s a great difference.&rdquo;&nbsp; Uncle
Isaac paused, and no further amplification of his proposition
occurring to him, he turned to Mrs. May.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow&rsquo;s trade?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Nan
May shook her head sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very bad, uncle,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hardly any at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
felt nearer crying than ever since the funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Uncle Isaac, sitting on a packing
case&mdash;empty, but intended to look full; &ldquo;ah, what you
want&rsquo;s Enterprise.&nbsp; Enterprise; that&rsquo;s what you
want.&nbsp; What is it as stimilates trade an&rsquo; encourages
prosperity to&mdash;to the latest improvements?&nbsp;
Enterprise.&nbsp; Why is commercial opulentness took&mdash;at
least, wafted&mdash;commercial opulentness wafted round the
&rsquo;ole world consekince o&rsquo; what?&nbsp; Consekince
o&rsquo; Enterprise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Uncle Isaac tapped the counter
with his forefinger and gazed solemnly in Nan May&rsquo;s
troubled face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Consekince o&rsquo;
Enterprise,&rdquo; he repeated slowly, with another tap.&nbsp;
Then he added briskly, with a glance at the inner door:
&ldquo;&rsquo;Adjer supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, uncle,&rdquo; Nan answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
thought of it.&nbsp; But, now you&rsquo;re here, p&rsquo;raps
you&rsquo;ll have a bit with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac
responded cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;That looks a nice little bit
o&rsquo; bacon.&nbsp; Now a rasher auf that, an&rsquo; a
hegg&mdash;got a hegg?&nbsp; O yus.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw a dozen
in a basin.&nbsp; &ldquo;A rasher auf that, an&rsquo; a hegg or
two, &rsquo;ud be just the thing, with a drop o&rsquo; beer,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny fetched the beer, and Uncle Isaac had two rashers and
four eggs; and he finished with a good solid <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>piece of
bread, and the first slice&mdash;a large one&mdash;out of the
Dutch cheese from the counter.&nbsp; Nan May made no more than a
pretence at eating a little bread and cheese.</p>
<p>When at last the jug was empty, and Uncle Isaac was full, he
leaned back in his chair, and for some minutes exercised his lips
in strange workings and twistings, with many incidental clicks
and sucks and fizzes, while he benignantly contemplated the angle
of the ceiling.&nbsp; When at last the display flagged, he
brought his gaze gradually lower, till it rested on the
diminished piece of bacon.&nbsp; &ldquo;None so bad, that
bacon,&rdquo; he observed, putting his head aside with a critical
regard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though p&rsquo;raps rayther more of a
breakfast specie than a supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; He laid his head to
the other side, as one anxious to be impartial.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yus,&rdquo; he went on thoughtfully, &ldquo;more of a
breakfast specie, as you might say.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then after a
pause, he added, with the air of one announcing a brilliant
notion:&mdash;&ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve&mdash;yus, I do
b&rsquo;lieve I&rsquo;ll try a bit for breakfast to-morrer
mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like, uncle,&rdquo; Nan answered, a little
faintly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;but-&rdquo;
timidly&mdash;&ldquo;I was thinking p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;ll make
it look rather small to&mdash;to put on the counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would&mdash;so it would,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac
admitted frankly; and indeed the remaining piece was scarce of
four rashers&rsquo; capacity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pity to cut it, as you
say, Nan.&nbsp; Thanks&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just wrop it up as it
is.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll come in for <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Monday too; an&rsquo; that large bit
o&rsquo; streaky&rsquo;ll look a deal more nobler on the
counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s visit swept away the day&rsquo;s profits
and a trifle more.&nbsp; But certainly, Uncle Isaac must not be
offended now that things looked so gloomy ahead.</p>
<p>Bessy lay, and strained her wits far into the night, inventing
comfortable theories and assurances, and exchanging them with her
mother for others as hopeful.&nbsp; But in the morning each
pillow had its wet spot.</p>
<h2><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>XII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Monday saw another
beginning.&nbsp; Johnny must rise soon after five now, to reach
his work at six; but on this, the first morning, he was awake and
eager at half-past four.&nbsp; Early as he was, his mother was
before him, and as he pulled his new white ducks over his
every-day clothes he could hear her moving below.&nbsp; Nan May
was resolved that the boy should go out to begin the world fed
and warm at least, and as cheerful as might be.</p>
<p>For this one morning Johnny felt nothing of the sleepy
discomfort of any house in pitch dark a little before five.&nbsp;
Two breakfasts were ready for him, one for the present moment
(which he scarce touched, for he was excited), and another in a
basin and a red handkerchief, for use at the workshop, with a new
tin can full of coffee.&nbsp; For the half-hour allowed for
breakfast would scarce suffice for the mere hurrying home and
hurrying back again; and the full hour at midday would give him
bare time for dinner with his mother.</p>
<p>Bessy was infected with the excitement, and stumped downstairs
to honour Johnny&rsquo;s setting out.&nbsp; He left the <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>shop-door
half an hour too soon, with a boot flung after him.&nbsp; The
darkness of the street seemed more solid at this hour than ever
at midnight, and it almost smothered the faint gas-lights.&nbsp;
Now and again a touch of sleet came down the wind, and a little
dirty, half-melted snow of yesterday made the ways sloppy.&nbsp;
Nobody was about, to view the manly glory of Johnny&rsquo;s white
ducks, and he was not sorry now that his overcoat largely hid
them, for the wind was cold.&nbsp; And he reflected with
satisfaction that the warming of his coffee on a furnace would
smoke the inglorious newness off the tin can ere he carried it
home in the open day.</p>
<p>The one or two policemen he met regarded him curiously, for
workmen were not yet moving.&nbsp; But the coffee-stall was open
by the swing bridge, and here the wind came over the river with
an added chill.&nbsp; The coffee-stall keeper had no customers,
and on the bridge and in the straight street beyond it nobody was
in sight.&nbsp; Till presently a small figure showed indistinctly
ahead, and crossed the road as though to avoid him.&nbsp; It
moved hurriedly, keeping timidly to the wall, and Johnny saw it
was a girl of something near his own age.&nbsp; He tramped on,
and the girl, once past, seemed to gather courage, turned, and
made a few steps after him.&nbsp; At this he stopped, and she
spoke from a few yards off.&nbsp; She was a decently-dressed and
rather a pretty girl, as he could see by the bad light of the
nearest lamp, <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>but her face was drawn with alarm, and her eyes were
wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please have you seen a lady anywhere?&rdquo; she asked
tremulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had seen no lady, ill or well, and when he said no, the
young girl, with a weak &ldquo;Thank-you,&rdquo; hastened on her
way.&nbsp; It was very odd, thought Johnny, as he stared into the
dark where she vanished.&nbsp; Who should lose a
lady&mdash;ill&mdash;in Blackwall streets at this time of a pitch
dark morning?&nbsp; As he thought, there rose in his mind the
picture of gran&rsquo;dad, straying and bloody and sick to death,
that night that seemed so far away, though it was but a month or
two since.&nbsp; Maybe the lady had wandered from her bed in some
such plight as that.&nbsp; Johnny was sorry for the girl&rsquo;s
trouble, and would have liked to turn aside and join in her
search; but this was the hour of great business of his own, and
he went his way about it.</p>
<p>The policemen were knocking at doors now, rousing workmen, who
answered with shouts from within.&nbsp; An old night-watchman,
too, scurrying his hardest (for he had farther to go than the
policemen), banged impatiently at the knockers of the more
conservative and old-fashioned.&nbsp; And as Johnny neared
Maidment and Hurst&rsquo;s, the streets grew busy with the
earliest workmen&mdash;those who lived farthest from their
labour.</p>
<p>Maidment and Hurst&rsquo;s gate was shut fast; he was <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>far too
soon.&nbsp; He tried the little door that was cut in the great
gate, but that was locked.&nbsp; He wondered if he ought to
knock; and did venture on a faint tap of the knuckles.&nbsp; But
he might as well have tapped the brick wall.&nbsp; Moreover, a
passing apprentice observed the act, and guffawed aloud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Try down the airey, mate,&rdquo; was his advice.</p>
<p>So Johnny stood and waited, keeping the new tin can where the
gaslight over the gate should not betray its unsmoked brightness,
and trying to look as much like an old hand as possible.&nbsp;
But the passing men grinned at each other, jerking their heads
toward him, and Johnny felt that somehow he was known for a
greenhorn.&nbsp; The apprentices, immeasurable weeks ahead of him
in experience, flung ironic advice and congratulation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hooray!&nbsp; Extry quarter for you, mate!&rdquo; two or
three said; one earnestly advising him to &ldquo;chalk it on the
gaffer&rsquo;s &rsquo;at, so&rsquo;s &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t
forget.&rdquo;&nbsp; And still another shouted in tones of
extravagant indignation:&mdash;&ldquo;What?&nbsp; On&rsquo;y
jes&rsquo; come?&nbsp; They bin a-waitin&rsquo; for ye ever since
the pubs shut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the timekeeper came, sour and grey, and tugged at a
vertical iron bell-handle which Johnny had not perceived.&nbsp;
The bell brought the night-watchman, with a lantern and a clank
of keys, and the timekeeper stepped through the little door with
a growl in <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>acknowledgment.&nbsp; He left the door ajar, and
Johnny, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, stepped in after
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cottam told me to come this morning, sir,&rdquo; he
said, before the timekeeper had quite disappeared into his
box.&nbsp; &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The timekeeper turned and growled again, that being his usual
manner of conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Awright,&rdquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wait there till &rsquo;e comes in
then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was many months ere Johnny next heard
him say so much at once.</p>
<p>The timekeeper began hanging round metal tickets on a great
board studded with hooks, a ticket to each hook, in numbered
order.&nbsp; Presently a man came in at the door, selected a
ticket from the board, and dropped it through a slot into what
seemed to be a big money-box.&nbsp; Then three came together, and
each did the same.&nbsp; Then there came a stream of men and
boys, and the board grew barer of tickets and barer.&nbsp; In the
midst came Mr. Cottam, suddenly appearing within the impossibly
small wicket as by a conjuring trick.</p>
<p>He tramped heavily straight ahead, apparently unconscious of
Johnny.&nbsp; But as he came by he dropped his hand on the
boy&rsquo;s shoulder, and, gazing steadily ahead: &ldquo;Well, me
lad!&rdquo; he roared, much as though addressing somebody at a
window of the factory across the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, sir,&rdquo; Johnny answered, walking at
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the
foreman&rsquo;s side by compulsion; for the hand, however
friendly, was the heaviest and strongest he had ever felt.</p>
<p>Mr. Cottam went several yards in silence, still gripping
Johnny&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; Then he spoke again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother all right?&rdquo; he asked fiercely, still
addressing the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, thank-you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on, and entered the factory.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
&rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Mr. Cottam, turning on Johnny at last and
glaring at him sternly: &ldquo;this &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s the big
shop.&nbsp; &rsquo;Eavy work.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a big cylinder
for the noo Red Star boat.&rdquo;&nbsp; He led his prisoner
through the big shop, this way and that among the great lathes
and planers, lit by gas from the rafters; and up a staircase to
another workshop.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere we are,&rdquo; said Mr.
Cottam, releasing Johnny&rsquo;s shoulder at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t a fool, are ye?&nbsp; Know what a
lathe is, doncher, an&rsquo; beltin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
shaftin&rsquo;?&nbsp; Awright.&nbsp; Needn&rsquo;t do
nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;fore breakfast.&nbsp; Look about an&rsquo;
see things, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t get in mischief.&nbsp; I got me
eye on ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreman left him, and began to walk along the lines of
machines; and the nearest apprentice grinned at Johnny, and
winked.&nbsp; Johnny looked about, as the foreman had
advised.&nbsp; This place, where he was to learn to make engines,
and where he was to work day by day till he was twenty-one, and a
man, was a vast <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>room with skylights in the roof: though this latter
circumstance he did not notice till after breakfast, when the gas
was turned off, and daylight penetrated from above.&nbsp; A
confusion of heavy raftering stretched below the roof, carrying
belted shafting everywhere; and every man bent over his machine
or his bench, for Cottam was a sharp gaffer.&nbsp; Johnny watched
the leading hand scribing curves on metal along lines already set
out by punctured dots.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lining off,&rdquo; said the
leading hand, seeing the boy&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; And then,
leaning over to speak, because of the workshop din:
&ldquo;Centre-dabs,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the dots.&nbsp;
<i>That</i>, at least, Johnny resolved not to forget: lining off
and centre-dabs.</p>
<p>For some reason&mdash;perhaps the usual reason, perhaps
another&mdash;three or four of the men were &ldquo;losing a
quarter&rdquo; that Monday morning, and some of them were men
with whom young apprentices had been working.&nbsp; Consequently,
Cottam, in addition to his general supervision, had to keep
particular watch on these mentorless lads, and Johnny learned a
little from the gaffer&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wotjer doin&rsquo; with that file?&rdquo; he
would ask of one.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a-playin&rsquo;
cat&rsquo;s cradle now, me lad!&nbsp; Look &rsquo;ere, keep
&rsquo;er level, like this!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a file, it
ain&rsquo;t a rockin&rsquo;-&rsquo;orse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or he would come behind another who was chipping <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>bye-metal,
and using a hammer with more zeal than skill.&nbsp; He would
watch for a moment, and then break out, &ldquo;Well, you are fond
o&rsquo; exercise, I must say!&nbsp; Good job you&rsquo;re strong
enough to stand it.&nbsp; <i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; My
constitootion won&rsquo;t allow me to &rsquo;old a &rsquo;ammer
like this &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;&nbsp; This with a burlesque of the
lad&rsquo;s stiff grasp and whole-arm action.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
&rsquo;ud knock me up.&nbsp; Bein&rsquo; a more delicate sort
o&rsquo; person&rdquo; (his arm was near as thick as the
boy&rsquo;s waist) &ldquo;I &rsquo;old a &rsquo;ammer like
this&mdash;see!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he took the shaft end loosely in
his fingers and hammered steadily and firmly from the
wrist.&nbsp; Johnny saw that and remembered.</p>
<p>Again, half an hour later, stopping at the elbow of another
apprentice, a little older than the last: &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
said the foreman, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a noo idea, that is!&nbsp;
Takin&rsquo; auf the skin from cast iron with a bran&rsquo; noo
file!&nbsp; I &rsquo;ope you&rsquo;ve patented it.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I &rsquo;ope you won&rsquo;t come an&rsquo; want
another file in about &rsquo;alf an hour, &rsquo;cos if you do
you won&rsquo;t git it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereat Johnny, astonished
to learn that cast iron had a skin, resolved not to forget that
you shouldn&rsquo;t take it off with a new file, and made a
mental note to ask somebody why.</p>
<p>Presently, as he came by the long fitting-bench, Johnny grew
aware of a fitter, immensely tall and very thin, who grinned and
nodded in furtive recognition.&nbsp; It was, indeed, the next
door lodger, who had painted the cornice.&nbsp; He was very
large, Johnny thought, to be so <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>shy; he positively blushed as he
grinned.&nbsp; &ldquo;You come to this shop?&rdquo; he asked in
his odd whisper, as he stooped to judge the fit of his
work.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beddin&rsquo; down a junk ring;
p&rsquo;raps the gaffer&rsquo;ll put you to &rsquo;elp me after
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bedding down a junk ring sounded advanced and technical, and
Johnny felt taller at the prospect.&nbsp; He would learn what a
junk ring was, probably, when he had to help bed it down.&nbsp;
Meanwhile he watched the tall man, as he brought the metal to an
exact face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop in to breakfast?&rdquo; the man asked, as he
stooped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some o&rsquo; the boys &rsquo;ll try a game with ye,
p&rsquo;raps.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind a little game, do
ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I couldn&rsquo;t stand it when I was a lad.&nbsp;
Made me mis&rsquo;rable.&nbsp; When ye go in the smiths&rsquo;
shop to git yer breakfast, look about ye, if they&rsquo;re
special kind findin&rsquo; y&rsquo; a seat.&nbsp; Up above,
f&rsquo;r instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny left the long man, and presently observed that the
foreman was not in the shop.&nbsp; There was an instant slackness
perceivable among the younger and less steady men, for the
leading hand had no such authority as Cottam.&nbsp; One man at a
lathe, throwing out his gear examined his work, and, turning to
Johnny, said, &ldquo;Look <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>&rsquo;ere, me lad; I want to true
this &rsquo;ere bit.&nbsp; Jes&rsquo; you go an&rsquo; ask Sam
Wilkins&mdash;that man up at the end there, in the serge
jacket&mdash;jes&rsquo; you go an&rsquo; ask &rsquo;im for the
round square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny knew the tool called a square, used for testing the
truth of finished work, though he had never seen a round
one.&nbsp; Howbeit he went off with alacrity: but it seemed that
Sam Wilkins hadn&rsquo;t the round square.&nbsp; It was Joe
Mills, over in the far corner.&nbsp; So he tried Joe Mills; but
he, it seemed, had just lent it to Bob White, at the biggest
shaping-machine near the other end.&nbsp; Bob White understood
perfectly, but thought he had last seen the round square in the
possession of George Walker.&nbsp; Whereas George Walker was
perfectly certain that it had gone downstairs to Bill Cook in the
big shop.&nbsp; Doubting nothing from the uncommonly solemn faces
of Sam and Joe and Bob and George, Johnny set off down the stone
stairs, where he met the ascending gaffer, on his way back from
the pattern-maker&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where you
goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Downstairs, sir, for the round square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cottam&rsquo;s eyes grew more prominent, and there were
certain sounds, as of an imprisoned bull-frog, from somewhere
deep in his throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; But his expression relaxed not a
shade.&nbsp; Presently he said, &ldquo;Know what a round
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what a square is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose somebody wanted a round square drored on
paper, what &rsquo;ud ye do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another internal croak, and somehow Johnny felt
emboldened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, with some sly
hesitation, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d tell &rsquo;em to do it
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cottam croaked again, louder, and this time with a heave
of the chest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Awright,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s good enough.&nbsp; Better say somethink like
that to them as sent ye.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a very old
&rsquo;ave, that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He resumed his heavy progress up the stairs, turning Johnny
round by the shoulder, and sending him in front.&nbsp; There were
furtive grins in the shop, and one lad asked &ldquo;Got
it?&rdquo; in a voice cautiously subdued.&nbsp; But just then the
bell rang for breakfast.</p>
<p>Most of the men and several of the boys made their best pace
for the gate.&nbsp; These either lived near, or got their
breakfasts at coffee-shops, and their half-hour began and ended
in haste.&nbsp; The few others, more leisurely, stayed to gather
their cans and handkerchiefs&mdash;some to wipe their hands on
cotton waste, that curious tangled stuff by which alone Johnny
remembered his father.&nbsp; As for him, he waited to do what the
rest did, for he saw that his friend, the long man, had gone out
with the patrons of coffee-shops.&nbsp; The boys took their cans
and <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>clattered down to the smiths&rsquo; shop, Johnny well
in the rear, for he was desirous of judging from a safe distance,
what form the &ldquo;little game&rdquo; might take, that the long
man had warned him of, in case it came soon.&nbsp; But a wayward
fate preserved him from booby-traps that morning.</p>
<p>In the first place, he had come in a cap, and so forfended one
ordeal.&nbsp; For it was the etiquette of the shop among
apprentices that any bowler hat brought in on the head of a new
lad must be pinned to the wall with the tangs of many files;
since a bowler hat, ere a lad had four years at least of service,
was a pretension, a vainglory, and an outrage.&nbsp; Next, his
lagging saved his new ducks.&nbsp; The first lads down had
prepared the customary trap, which consisted of a seat of honour
in the best place near the fire; a seat doctored with a pool of
oil, and situated exactly beneath a rafter on which stood a can
of water taken from a lathe; a string depending from the can,
with its lower end fastened behind the seat.&nbsp; So that the
victim accepting the accommodation would receive a large oily
embellishment on his new white ducks, and, by the impact of his
back against the string, induce a copious christening of himself
and his entire outfit.&nbsp; But it chanced that an elderly
journeyman from the big shop&mdash;old Ben Cutts&mdash;appeared
on the scene early, wiping his spectacles on his jacket lining as
he came.&nbsp; He knew nothing of a <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>fresh &rsquo;prentice, saw nothing
but a convenient and warm seat, and hastened to seize it.</p>
<p>The lads were taken by surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&mdash;not
there!&rdquo; shouted one a few yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fust come fust served, me lad,&rdquo; chuckled old Ben
Cutts, as he dropped on the fatal spot.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere I
am, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ere I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the can fell, and Johnny at the door was astonished
to observe a grey-headed workman, with a pair of spectacles in
his hand and a vast oily patch on his white overalls, dripping
and dancing and swearing, and smacking wildly at the heads of the
boys about him, without hitting any.</p>
<p>There were no more tricks that breakfast-time.&nbsp; For when
at length old Ben subsided to his meal, he put a little pile of
wedges by his side, to fling at the first boy of whose behaviour
he might disapprove.&nbsp; And as his spectacles were now on his
nose, and his aim, thus aided, was known to be no bad one, and as
the wedges, furthermore, were both hard and heavy, breakfasts
were eaten with all the decorum possible in a smiths&rsquo;
shop.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s new can was satisfactorily blackened, and his
breakfast was well disposed of.&nbsp; Such youths as tried him
with verbal chaff he answered as well as he might, though he had
as yet little of the Cockney boy&rsquo;s readiness.&nbsp; And at
last the bell rang again, and the breakfasters went back to
work.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Mr.
Cottam, casting his glance about the shop in search of the
simplest possible job for Johnny to begin on, with a steady man
at hand to watch him, stopped as his gaze reached Long Hicks, and
sent Johnny to help him with his bolts.&nbsp; And so Johnny found
the tall man&rsquo;s surmise verified, and the tall man himself
received him with another grin a little less shy.&nbsp; He set
him to running down bolts and nuts, showing him how to fix the
bolt in a vice and work the nut on it with a spanner.&nbsp;
Johnny fell to the task enthusiastically, and so the morning
went.</p>
<h2><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>XIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Nan May opened shop, she saw
that men were pulling down as much of the ship-yard wall opposite
as stood between two chalk lines.&nbsp; She thought no more of
the thing at the time, not guessing how nearly it concerned
her.&nbsp; For this was to be a new workmen&rsquo;s gate to the
ship-yard and passing workmen might change the fortunes of a
shop.&nbsp; For that day, however, there was no sign but the
demand of a bricklayer&rsquo;s labourer for a penn&rsquo;orth of
cheese.</p>
<p>It was as bad a day as Saturday, in the matter of
trade&mdash;indeed there was no drunken man to buy lard&mdash;and
the woman&rsquo;s heart grew heavier as the empty hours
went.&nbsp; Bessy stood at the back-parlour door, pale and
anxious, but striving to lift a brave face.&nbsp; Before one
o&rsquo;clock there was dinner to be prepared; not that either
Bessy or her mother could eat, but for Johnny.&nbsp; And at a
quarter past one both met him at the door as cheerfully as they
could; and indeed they were eager to hear of his fortunes.&nbsp;
They wondered to see him coming with the long man who lived next
door; and the long man, for his part, was awkward and nervous
when <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>he
saw them.&nbsp; At first he hung back, as though to let Johnny go
on alone; but he changed his mind, and came striding ahead
hastily, looking neither to right nor to left, and plunged in at
his door.</p>
<p>Johnny was hungry and in high spirits.&nbsp; He and Long
Hicks, it seemed, had been bedding down a junk ring for a piston,
Johnny easing the bolts and nuts, and Long Hicks doing the other
work.&nbsp; He said nothing of the round square, but talked
greatly of slide-valves and cranks, till Bessy judged him a full
engineer already.&nbsp; Between his mouthfuls he illustrated the
proper handling of hammer and file, and reprehended the sinful
waste of spoiling the surface of a new file on the outer skin of
a fresh iron casting.&nbsp; It cheered Nan May to see the boy
taking so heartily to his work, through all her secret dread that
she might lack the means to keep him at it.&nbsp; Johnny glanced
anxiously at the clock from time to time, and at last declared
that he must knock for Long Hicks, who was plainly forgetting how
late it was.&nbsp; And in the end he rushed away to disturb the
tall man ten minutes too soon, and hurried off to Maidment and
Hurst&rsquo;s, there to take his own new metal ticket from the
great board, and drop it duly into the box.</p>
<p>The afternoon went busily at the factory, and busy days
followed.&nbsp; Johnny acquired his first tool, a steel
foot-rule, and carried it in public places with a full <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>quarter of
its length visible at the top of its appointed pocket.&nbsp; It
was the way of all young apprentices to do this; the rule, they
would say, thus being carried convenient for the hand.&nbsp; But
it was an exact science among the observant to judge a
lad&rsquo;s experience inversely by scale of the inches exposed,
going at the rate of half an inch a year.&nbsp; A lad through two
years of his &ldquo;time&rdquo; would show no more of his rule
than two inches; by the end of four years one of these inches
would have vanished; as his twenty-first birthday approached, the
last inch shrank to a mere hint of bright metal; and nobody ever
saw the foot-rule of a full journeyman, except he were using
it.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s christening, postponed by the accident of old
Ben Cutts, came when he was first put to a small lathe to try his
hand at turning bolts.&nbsp; For when, returning from breakfast,
he belted his lathe, he did not perceive that the water-can had
been tied to the belt; realising it, however, the next instant,
when it flew over the shafting and discharged the water on his
head.&nbsp; Then he was free of the shop; suffering no more than
the rest from the workshop pranks habitual among the younger
lads, and joining in them: gammoning newer lads than himself with
demands for the round square, and oppressing them with urgent
messages to testy gaffers&mdash;that a cockroach had got in the
foo-foo valve, that the donkey-man wanted an order for a new
nosebag, and the like.&nbsp; <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Grew able, moreover, in workshop
policy, making good interest with the storekeeper, who might
sometimes oblige with the loan of a hammer.&nbsp; For a lost
hammer meant a fine of three-and-sixpence, and when yours was
stolen&mdash;everybody stole everybody else&rsquo;s
hammer&mdash;a borrowed one would tide you over till you could
steal another.&nbsp; Making friends, too, with the tool-smith, at
a slight expense in drinks; though able to punish him also if
necessary, by the secret bedevilment of his fire with iron
borings.&nbsp; Learned to manufacture an apparent water-crack by
way of excuse for a broken file&mdash;a water-crack made with a
touch of grease well squeezed between the broken ends.&nbsp; In
short, became an initiated &rsquo;prentice engineer.&nbsp; In the
trade itself, moreover, he was not slow, and Mr. Cottam had once
mentioned him (though Johnny did not know it) as &ldquo;none so
bad a boy; one as can work &rsquo;is own &rsquo;ead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Until his first enthusiasm had worn off, he never ceased from
questioning Long Hicks, in his hours of leisure, on matters
concerning steam-engines; so that the retiring Hicks grew almost
out of touch with the accordion that had been the solace of his
solitude.&nbsp; The tall man had never met quite so inquisitive
an apprentice; engineering was in the blood, he supposed.&nbsp;
He had guessed the boy&rsquo;s mother an engineer&rsquo;s wife
when first Johnny came to his bench, because of the extra button
Nan May had been careful to sew on his jacket cuff; a button used
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>to
tighten the sleeve, that it might not catch the driver on a
lathe.</p>
<p>It was early in Johnny&rsquo;s experience&mdash;indeed he had
been scarce a fortnight at the engine-shop&mdash;when a man
coming in from an outdoor job just before dinner told Cottam the
foreman, that an old friend was awaiting him at the gate, looking
for a job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; &rsquo;oo&rsquo;s the ol&rsquo;
friend?&rdquo; asked Cottam, severely distrustful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. &rsquo;Enery Butson, Esquire,&rdquo; the man
answered, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; Butson?&rdquo; the gaffer ejaculated, and
his eyes grew rounder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Butson?&nbsp; Agen?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d&mdash;damme, I&rsquo;d as soon &rsquo;ave a brass
monkey!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Cottam stumped indignantly up the
shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing&rsquo;lar, that,&rdquo; observed a labourer who
was helping an erector with a little yacht engine near
Johnny&rsquo;s bench.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sing&rsquo;lar like what I
&rsquo;eard the gaffer say at Lumley&rsquo;s when Butson wanted a
job there.&nbsp; &lsquo;What?&rsquo; sez &rsquo;e.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Butson?&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;d rayther &rsquo;ave a chaney
dawg auf my gran&rsquo;mother&rsquo;s mantelpiece,&rsquo;
&rsquo;e sez.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;E wouldn&rsquo;t spile
castin&rsquo;s,&rsquo; &rsquo;e sez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were grins between the men who heard, for it would seem
that Mr. Butson was not unknown among them.&nbsp; But when Johnny
told his mother at dinner, she thought the men rude and ignorant;
and she was especially surprised at Mr. Cottam.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>For
some little while Johnny wondered at the girl who was hunting for
a sick lady in the street on that dark Monday morning.&nbsp; He
looked out for her on his way to and from his work, resolved, if
he met her, to ask how the search had fared, and how the lady
was.&nbsp; But he saw nothing of her, and the thing began to drop
from his mind.&nbsp; Till a Saturday afternoon, when he went to
see a new &ldquo;ram&rdquo; launched; for half-way to the
ship-yard he saw a pretty girl&mdash;and surely it was the
same.&nbsp; In no tears nor trouble now, indeed, but most
disconcertingly composed and dignified&mdash;yet surely the
same.&nbsp; Johnny hesitated, and stopped: and then most
precipitately resumed his walk.&nbsp; For truly this was a very
awful young person, icily unconscious of him, her casual glance
flung serenely through his head and over it. . . .&nbsp; Perhaps
it wasn&rsquo;t the same, after all; and if not&mdash;well it was
lucky he had said nothing. . . .&nbsp; Nevertheless his inner
feeling was that he had made no mistake; more, that the girl
remembered him, but was proud and would not own it.&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t matter, he said to himself.&nbsp; But the afternoon
went a little flat; the launch was less interesting than one
might have expected.&nbsp; There was a great iron hull, tricked
out with flags; and when men knocked away the dog-shores with
sledge-hammers, the ship slid away, cradle and all, into the
water.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t much in that.&nbsp; Of course, if
you knocked away the dog-shores, the ship was bound <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>to slide:
plainly enough.&nbsp; <i>That</i> wasn&rsquo;t very
interesting.&nbsp; Johnny felt vaguely resentful of the
proceedings. . . .&nbsp; But still he wondered afresh at the lost
lady who was ill out of doors so early in the morning.</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>XIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this launch was when
Johnny&rsquo;s &rsquo;prentice teeth were cut: when the running
down of bolts and pins was beneath his notice, and he could be
trusted with work at a small nibbling machine; when he had turned
stop-valve spindles more than once, and felt secretly confident
of his ability to cut a screw.</p>
<p>Meantime history was making at the shop: very slowly at first,
it is true.&nbsp; The holly had been made the most of; but it
seemed to attract not at all.&nbsp; Penn&rsquo;orths and
ha&rsquo;porths were most of the sales, and even they were
few.&nbsp; Nan May grew haggard and desperate.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac
had called once soon after the opening Saturday, but since had
been a stranger.&nbsp; He had said that he was about to change
his lodgings (he was a widower), but Nan knew nothing of his new
address.&nbsp; In truth, such was Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s tenderness
of heart, that he disliked the sight or complaint of distress;
and, in the manner of many other people of similar tenderness, he
betook himself as far as possible from the scene thereof, and
kept there.</p>
<p>It was within a few days of Christmas when things <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>seemed
hopeless.&nbsp; Johnny, indeed, had never ceased to hope till
now.&nbsp; He had talked of the certainty of struggling on
somehow till his wages were enough for all; indeed, even the six
shillings a week seemed something considerable now, though he
knew that the rent alone came to ten.&nbsp; But even
Johnny&rsquo;s cheerfulness fell in face of the intenser
dejection, the more open tears, of his mother and sister, as the
days wore on.&nbsp; Long Hicks found him a quieter, less
inquisitive boy, and a duller help than at first; and dinner at
home was a sad make-believe.&nbsp; Each knew that the other two
were contrasting the coming Christmas with the last.&nbsp; Then,
gran&rsquo;dad was with them, hale and merry; to look out of
window was to look through a world of frosty twigs to woody deeps
where the deer waited, timid and shadowy, for the crusts flung
out afar for them from the garden.&nbsp; Now . . . but there!</p>
<p>But it was just at this desperate time that a change came, as
by magic.&nbsp; The men who pulled down the wall at the opposite
side of the street gave place to others who built a mighty brick
pier at each side of the opening: a pier designed to carry its
half of the new gate.&nbsp; But ere the work was near complete,
men and boys from the yard found it a convenient place to slip
out and in at, on breakfast-time or dinner-time errands.</p>
<p>Now it chanced at the time that one of these men was in a
domestic difficulty; a difficulty that a large <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>part of the
eight or nine hundred men of the ship-yard encountered in turn at
more or less regular intervals.&nbsp; His wife inhabited the
bedroom in company with a monthly nurse; while he roosted
sleeplessly at night on a slippery horsehair couch in the
parlour, or wallowed in a jumble of spare blankets and old coats
on the floor; spending his home hours by day in desolate muddling
in the kitchen, lost and incapable, and abject before the tyranny
of the nurse.&nbsp; On dark mornings he made forlorn attempts at
raking together a breakfast to carry with him to work; but as he
had taken no thought to put anything into the cupboard over
night, he found it no easy matter to extract a breakfast from it
in the morning.&nbsp; So it came to pass that on the second day
of his affliction this bedevilled husband, his hunger merely
aggravated by the stale lumps of bread he had thought to make
shift on, issued forth at the new gate in quest of
breakfast.&nbsp; There was little time, and most of the shops
were a distance off; but just opposite was a flaming little
chandler&rsquo;s shop, newly opened.&nbsp; It was thinly stocked
enough, but it would be hard luck indeed if it did not hold
something eatable.&nbsp; And so Nan May&rsquo;s first customer
that day was the starved husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got anythink t&rsquo; eat?&rdquo; he asked, his
ravening gaze piercing the bare corners of the shop.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Got any bacon?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Nan May answered, reaching for
the insignificant bit of &ldquo;streaky&rdquo; that was all she
had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;cooked, I mean.&nbsp; Aincher got any cold
boiled &rsquo;ock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; ought t&rsquo; ave some cooked
&rsquo;ock.&nbsp; Lots &rsquo;ud &rsquo;ave it in the yard.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t eat <i>that</i>&mdash;the smiths&rsquo; shop
&rsquo;s the other end o&rsquo; the yard, an&rsquo; I got nothing
to toast it with.&nbsp; Aincher got nothing else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan May grasped the situation, and conceived an instant
notion, for indeed she had inborn talent as a shopkeeper, though
till now it had had no chance to show itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
you wait five minutes?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Yes, he would wait five minutes, but no more: and he sat on
the empty case, from which Uncle Isaac had delivered his
recommendation of Enterprise.&nbsp; Nan May cut two rashers and
retired to the shop parlour.&nbsp; In three minutes the hungry
customer was hammering on the counter, declaring that he could
wait no longer.&nbsp; Pacified by assurances from within, he
resigned himself to a minute and a half more of patience: when
Mrs. May returned with a massive sandwich, wherein the two
rashers, fresh frizzled, lay between two thick slices of
bread.&nbsp; Lifting the top slice for a moment, as guarantee of
good faith, Nan May exchanged the whole ration for
threepence.</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like any cold boiled bacon,
sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall have some at one
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard, but he was off at a trot with his sandwich.&nbsp; In
five minutes Nan May&rsquo;s bonnet was on, and in five more
Bessy was minding shop alone, while her mother hastened to Mr.
Dunkin&rsquo;s for a hock of bacon.&nbsp; Here was a possible
change of fortune, and Nan May was not a woman to waste a
chance.</p>
<p>Boiled and cooled&mdash;or cooled enough for the taste of
hungry riveters&mdash;the hock stood in a dish on the counter at
one o&rsquo;clock, flanked by carving-knife and fork.&nbsp; A
card, bearing the best 10 that Bessy could draw, advertised the
price, and the first quarter-pound of slices was duly cut for the
desolate husband, who came back, a little later, for two ounces
more; for he had been ill-fed for two or three days, and the new
baby made an event wherewith some extra expense was
natural.&nbsp; Boys came for two other quarter-pounds, so that it
was plain that the first customer had told others; and a loaf was
cut up to go with the bacon.</p>
<p>Mrs. May announced the new branch of trade to Johnny when he
came to dinner; and though as yet the returns were small enough,
there was a new chance, and his mother was hopeful of it; so he
went back to the lathe with a lighter heart.</p>
<p>That night the riveters worked overtime, and the <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>bacon was
in better demand still.&nbsp; More, at night two or three men
took home a snack in paper, for supper; and from that day things
grew better daily.&nbsp; The hock was finished by the afternoon
of the next day, and the establishment was out of pickles; for
men and boys who brought their own cold meat with them came now
for pickles.&nbsp; Trade was better as the days went on, and
Christmas, though it found them poor enough, was none so sad a
festival after all.&nbsp; And in a month, when the gate had been
formally opened for some time, and the men streamed by in
hundreds, three large hocks would rarely last two days; and there
was an average profit of three shillings a hock.&nbsp; More, the
bread came in daily in batches, at trade price, and cheese and
pickles went merrily.&nbsp; But what went best, and what
increased in sale even beyond this point, was the bacon.&nbsp;
Some customers called it ham, which pleased Nan May; for indeed
her cooking hit the popular taste, and she began to feel a pride
in it.&nbsp; Men who went home to dinner would buy bacon to take
home for tea; and as many of these lived in Harbour Lane and
thereabout, custom soon came from their wives, in soap and
candles, treacle and pepper and blacking.&nbsp; Nan May&rsquo;s
trade instinct grew with exercise.&nbsp; She found the particular
sort of bacon that best suited her purpose and her
customers&rsquo; tastes; she had regular boilings throughout the
week; she quickly found the trick of judging the quality of <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>whatever
she bought; and she bought to the best use of her money.</p>
<p>But here it must be said that Nan May, in her new prosperity,
behaved toward one benefactor with an undutiful forgetfulness
that was near ingratitude.&nbsp; For she bought almost nothing of
Mr. Dunkin.&nbsp; He was reasonably grieved.&nbsp; True, she had
begun by getting her first stock of him, but even then her
critical examination of what was sent showed an unworthily
suspicious attitude of mind.&nbsp; She even sent back many things
and demanded better, wilfully blind to the fact that Mr. Dunkin
could turn her out of the shop at a week&rsquo;s notice if he
pleased; though indeed in his own mind he was not vindictive, for
another new tenant would be hard to find.&nbsp; He even submitted
to outrage ending in actual loss and humiliation.&nbsp; For a
large tin of mustard was Mrs. May&rsquo;s first supply, and it
was a tin from among those kept for sale to small shopkeepers,
and not on any account to be sold from retail, across Mr.
Dunkin&rsquo;s own counter.&nbsp; But something in the feel and
taste of this mustard did not please Nan May (though indeed
<i>she</i> was not asked to eat it), and it went back.&nbsp; Now
it chanced that Mr. Dunkin had taken on a new shopman that week,
and this bungling incapable straightway began selling mustard
from the returned tin.&nbsp; He had served three customers before
his blunder was perceived, and then the matter came to light
purely because the third customer chanced <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>to be a
food and drug inspector.&nbsp; This functionary gravely announced
himself as soon as he had good hold of the parcel, and handsomely
offered the return of a third part of the mustard, in a sealed
packet.&nbsp; And the upshot was a fine of five pounds and costs
for Mr. Dunkin, on the opinionative evidence of an analyst, who
talked of starch and turmeric and ginger&mdash;all very excellent
substances, as anybody knows.&nbsp; Truly it was a vexatious blow
for Mr. Dunkin, and an unjust; for certainly the fault was not
his, and to sell such an article, retail, was wholly against his
principles.&nbsp; But he never complained, such was his
forbearance: never spoke of his hardship to a soul, in fact,
except when he &ldquo;sacked&rdquo; the new assistant.&nbsp; It
was even said that he had offered a reporter money to keep it out
of the papers; and though it <i>did</i> get into the papers (and
at good length too) yet the effort was kindly meant.&nbsp; For
truly it could but give Mrs. May pain to learn that she had been
the cause of Mr. Dunkin&rsquo;s misfortune, if she were a woman
of any feeling at all.</p>
<p>But as time went, he began to doubt if she were, for her
custom dropped away to nothing.&nbsp; The rate at which bacon was
handed in from the cart of a firm somewhere in the Borough, was
scandalous to behold.&nbsp; Before his very eyes, too, when he
called for the rent.&nbsp; He employed a collector, but presently
took to coming for the rent himself, that by his presence and his
manner he might shame <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>so thankless a tenant into some
sense of decency, some order for bacon or mustard.&nbsp; He
coughed gently and stared very hard at the incoming goods, but
Nan May was in no wise abashed, and gave the carman his
directions with shameless composure.&nbsp; With his sympathetic
stop full out, Mr. Dunkin asked how trade was, and Nan May
answered in proper shopkeeper terms, that &ldquo;she
mustn&rsquo;t grumble.&rdquo;&nbsp; With hums and purrs, he led
back through casual questions and answers to the stock he had at
first supplied, and asked her how she had done with this, and how
that had &ldquo;gone off.&rdquo;&nbsp; But her answers were so
artlessly direct, so inconsiderately truthful, that good Mr.
Dunkin was clean baffled, and reduced at last to a desperate hint
that if anything were wanted he could take the order back with
him.&nbsp; But he got no order, so he purred and hummed his way
into Harbour Lane, and so away; and after a time the collector
came in his stead.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunkin resolved to wait.&nbsp; He had some doubts of the
permanence of this new prosperity in the shop.&nbsp; The place
had never brought anybody a living yet, and he should not feel
convinced till he had seen steady trade there for some
time.&nbsp; Nan May&rsquo;s activities could always be kept from
flagging by judicious increases of rent, and <i>if</i> the thing
grew well established by her exertions, and was certain to
continue a paying concern, why, here would be a new branch of Mr.
Dunkin&rsquo;s business ready made.&nbsp; <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>It needed
but a week&rsquo;s notice, given unexpectedly, at a properly
chosen time, when no neighbouring shop was to let, and a good
stroke of business was happily completed.&nbsp; Mrs. May would
vanish, a man would go in to manage at a pound or twenty-five
shillings a week and his quarters, there would be no interruption
to trade (for the outgoing tenant would naturally keep at work
till the last minute, to get what little she could), and Mr.
Dunkin would have a new branch, paying very excellently, with no
trouble to himself.&nbsp; Mr. Dunkin had established other
branches in the same way, and found it a very simple and cheap
arrangement.&nbsp; There was no risk of his own capital, no
trouble in &ldquo;working-up&rdquo; the trade, no cost of
goodwill, and rent was coming regularly while the tenant laboured
with the zeal of a man who imagines he is working for his own
benefit and his children&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The important thing was
to give nothing but a weekly tenancy; else the tenant might find
time to get going somewhere near at hand, and so perhaps deprive
Mr. Dunkin of the just reward of his sagacity, foresight, and
patience.&nbsp; But there was little difficulty in that
matter.&nbsp; Beginners were timid and glad of a weekly tenancy,
fearing the responsibility of anything longer, at first; and
afterwards&mdash;well, things were in a groove, and Mr. Dunkin
was so very kind and sympathetic that it wasn&rsquo;t worth while
to bother about a change.&nbsp; And by this method Mr. Dunkin,
judiciously selecting his purchases in shop property, had
acquired <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>two or three of his half-dozen branches, and flourished
exceedingly; which all kindly souls rejoiced to see.</p>
<p>In the beginning he had no thought of this plan for the
Harbour Lane shop, being mainly concerned to get a tenant, no
matter in what trade; and indeed in his eye the place was as
little suited for chandlery as for anything.&nbsp; Even now he
must wait, for he doubted the lasting quality of the new
prosperity; better a few years of forbearance than a too hurried
seizure of a weakening concern, to find little more than the same
tenantless shop on his hands after all.&nbsp; And if it seemed
that the trade owed anything to the personal qualities and
connexions of Mrs. May, well, it would be a simple thing to keep
her on to manage, instead of a man.&nbsp; It would be an act of
benevolence, moreover, to an unfortunate widow, and come
cheaper.&nbsp; But that was a matter for the future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nan May, active and confident, filled her shop by
purchase from whatsoever factor sold best and cheapest, and
travellers called for her orders.&nbsp; The hungry husband who
first came for cooked bacon she always treated with particular
consideration, finding him good cuts.&nbsp; He ceased his regular
visits in three weeks or less, and Nan May, taught by experience
in her earlier London life, well guessed the cause of his
coming.&nbsp; In the spring, three months or so later, great
crowds thronged about the ship-yard to see the launch of the
battleship that overtime had so long been worked on; and when the
<a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>launch
was over, this man and his wife, the man carrying the baby, came
into the shop for something to celebrate the occasion at
tea.&nbsp; The parents did not altogether comprehend Nan
May&rsquo;s enthusiasm over the baby, which she took from its
father&rsquo;s arms and danced merrily about the shop, while
customers waited.&nbsp; But they set it down to admiration of its
personal beauty, though truly it was an ordinary slobbery baby
enough.&nbsp; But it went away down the street in great state,
triumphantly stabbing at its mouth with the sugarstick gripped by
one hand, and at its father&rsquo;s whiskers with that brandished
in the other.</p>
<h2><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>XV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a Saturday afternoon about this
time, Uncle Isaac, in his best black suit and very tall hat, and
with the Turk&rsquo;s-head walking-stick in his hand, started out
to see a foreman.&nbsp; Work was rather slack just now
(shipwrights&rsquo; work was slack everywhere), and the three
holidays a week that once were the glory and boast of a free and
independent shipwright, were now apt to be a woeful
compulsion.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac had been of late poorer (because
idler) than he liked, and in such case it was his way to seek the
chance of meeting his foreman out of hours, in order to a display
of rhetoric, oblique flattery, and dexterous suggestion, that
might influence a distribution of short time that would be more
favourable to the orator.</p>
<p>He had wondered much as to the fortunes of Nan and her
children, but as it has been said, his tenderness of heart kept
him as far as possible from what he believed must now be a scene
of sheer failure and destitution: if, indeed, the shop were not
abandoned; and he was by no means anxious that his poor relations
should discover his new lodgings.&nbsp; So now he picked his way
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>with
circumspection, and with careful cogitation of a mental map of
the streets; because a thoughtless straightforward journey would
take him much too near to Harbour Lane.</p>
<p>He crossed a swing bridge that gave access to a hundred and
fifty yards of roadway ending in another swing bridge.&nbsp; But
there was a crook in the road, and when he passed it he found
that the second bridge was open.&nbsp; Now in Blackwall an
&ldquo;open&rdquo; bridge did not mean one that the passenger
could cross; that was a &ldquo;shut&rdquo; bridge.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;open&rdquo; bridge was one swung aside to let a ship
through, as a pair of gates is opened for a carriage.&nbsp; So
Uncle Isaac resigned himself to wait, with an increasingly
impatient group, till the bridge should swing into place again
and give passage.&nbsp; He stood behind the chain that hung
across the road to check traffic, and meditatively rubbed his
nose with the Turk&rsquo;s-head.&nbsp; Presently he grew
conscious of a rusty figure on his left, edging unsteadily a
little nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow do, Mr. Mundy?&rdquo; came a hoarse
whisper.&nbsp; And Mother Born-drunk, a trifle less drunk than
usual, but careful to grasp a post, leered a grimy leer and waved
her disengaged hand in his face, as one saluting a friend at a
great distance.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac emitted a non-committal
grunt&mdash;one that might be taken for an accidental cough by
the bystanders&mdash;and sidled a foot or two away.&nbsp; For he,
too, had known Emma Pacey in her more decent <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>days, and,
with other acquaintances of that time, was sometimes put to
shifts to avoid her.</p>
<p>Mother Born-drunk left the post and followed her victim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo; run &rsquo;way,&rdquo; she ejaculated,
unsteadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ole pal.&nbsp; Mish&rsquo;
Mundy!&rdquo;&nbsp; She thrust out a foul paw, and dropped her
voice coaxingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Len&rsquo;sh twopence!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Uncle Isaac gazed uneasily in another direction, and took more
ground to the right.&nbsp; The waiting passengers, glad of a
little amusement, grinned one at another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J&rsquo;year, Mr. Mundy!&rdquo;&nbsp; This in a loud
voice, with an imperious gesture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;J&rsquo;year!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;tche&rsquo; answer when a
lady speaks t&rsquo;ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, guv&rsquo;nor!&rdquo; said a boy encouragingly,
sitting on a post.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s yer manners?&nbsp;
Take auf yer &rsquo;at to the laidy!&rdquo;&nbsp; And there was a
snigger.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac shifted farther still, and put a group
of men between himself and his persecutor.&nbsp; But she was not
to be so easily shaken off.&nbsp; Drawing herself up with a
scornful majesty that was marred by an occasional lurch, and the
bobbing of the tangled bonnet hanging over one ear, she came
after Uncle Isaac through the passage readily made by the knot of
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! so it&rsquo;s this, is it,&rdquo; she declaimed,
with a stately backward sweep of the arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;If a lady
asks a triflin&rsquo; favour you insult &rsquo;er.&nbsp; Ye low,
common, scoundrel!&rdquo;&nbsp; This very slowly, with a deep
tragedy hiss and a long <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>pause.&nbsp; Then with a piercing
note of appeal: &ldquo;Mr. Mundy!&nbsp; I demand an answer!&nbsp;
Once more!&nbsp; <i>Will</i> you lend me twopence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people (a small crowd by this time) forgot the troublesome
bridge, and turned to the new diversion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give the
laidy twopence!&rdquo; roared the boy on the post, in a deep
bass.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Arf a pint &rsquo;ud save &rsquo;er
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac looked desperately about him, but he saw no
sympathy.&nbsp; Dockmen, workmen, boys&mdash;all were agog to see
as much fun as possible in the time at disposal.&nbsp; The
pursuing harpy came a step nearer, and bawled again,
&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you lend me twopence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Uncle Isaac, driven to bay at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Go away!&nbsp; Go
away, you&mdash;you infamious creacher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not by no means.&nbsp; Go away.&nbsp; Y&rsquo;ought
to be ashamed of yerself, you&mdash;you&mdash;you opstroperous
faggit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calls &rsquo;isself a gen&rsquo;leman,&rdquo; she said,
lifting her gaze to the clouds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Calls &rsquo;isself
a gen&rsquo;leman, an&rsquo; uses such language to a
lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shockin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said one in the hilarious
crowd.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a wicked ole bloke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac gave another unquiet glance about him, and moved
another yard.&nbsp; The woman brought her eyes to earth again,
and: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t gimme twopence,&rdquo; she <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>proclaimed,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a orficer&rsquo;s widow!&nbsp; Never
mind, len&rsquo; me a penny; on&rsquo;y a penny, Mr. Mundy.&nbsp;
Do, there&rsquo;sh a dear!&nbsp; O you <i>are</i> a ole
duck!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mother Born-drunk stumbled toward Uncle
Isaac with affectionately extended arms.</p>
<p>The crowd shrieked with joy, but Uncle Isaac turned and ran,
one hand clapped to the crown of his very tall hat.&nbsp; He
would wait for no bridge now, but get away as best he
could.&nbsp; The boys yelled and whistled, and kept up at an easy
trot with the quick scuttle of his short legs; behind them came
Mother Born-drunk, tripping and floundering, spurred to infuriate
chase by sight and sound of her unchanging enemies, the boys, and
growing at every step more desirous of clawing at one of them
than of catching Uncle Isaac.</p>
<p>As for him, he dropped his hat once, and nearly fell on it, in
looking behind.&nbsp; So he thrust it under his arm as he
scurried past the bend in the road; and there despair seized him,
for now the other bridge was open too.&nbsp; Which escape might
he make first?&nbsp; At the end from which he had turned back, a
great liner was being towed through at a snail&rsquo;s pace,
funnels and masts scarce seeming to move across the street.&nbsp;
But at this end a small coaster went out briskly, and her mizzen
was more than half over now.&nbsp; The woman was less than twenty
yards off, but though she still staggered nearer, she was engaged
with boys.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac put <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>panic aside, and resolved on
dignity.&nbsp; He took his hat from under his arm, and began to
brush it on his sleeve.</p>
<p>Mother Born-drunk was in the hands of her enemies, though
there were fewer than usual.&nbsp; She swore and swiped at them,
and they flung and yelled and danced.&nbsp; But they drew nearer
Uncle Isaac, for it was a new variation in the sport to involve
an old gentleman with his Sunday clothes on.&nbsp; Then shouted
the woman breathlessly: &ldquo;P&rsquo;lice! p&rsquo;lice!&nbsp;
Mish&rsquo; Mundy, I&rsquo;ll give y&rsquo; in charge for
annoyin&rsquo; me.&nbsp; &rsquo;J&rsquo;ear!&rdquo;&nbsp; She
came very near and made a catch at him, which he dodged without
regard to dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mish&rsquo; Mundy!&nbsp; Stand a
drop&mdash;just a little drop for ole times!&nbsp; If ye
don&rsquo;t stand a drop I&rsquo;ll give y&rsquo; in
charge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coaster was through, and soon the bridge would shut.&nbsp;
Uncle Isaac moved up toward the chain amid shouts and
jibes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Y&rsquo;ought to be ashamed o&rsquo;
yerself,&rdquo; bawled the woman, &ldquo;a ole man like you,
annoyin&rsquo; a lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men were at the winch, and the bridge swung.&nbsp;
First of all the impatient passengers, Uncle Isaac sprang on the
moving iron and got across at peril of life and limb ere the
sections were still.&nbsp; He heard a louder shout of laughter
from behind, where Mother Born-drunk, forgetting the chain as she
made for the <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>bridge, had sprawled over it where it hung low in the
middle; and he quickened his pace.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that Johnny May had been taken that week to his
first out-door job, on a large steamer; and, full of the wonders
of the ship, he had made interest with the &ldquo;shippy&rdquo;
(who was officially called the shipkeeper) to bring Bessy on
board on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; The visit was a pure delight
for both, with more than a spice of danger for Bessy in climbing
gangways, companions, and greasy engine-room steps; indeed, the
&ldquo;shippy&rdquo; carried her down the lower flights of these
last.&nbsp; Johnny explained the prodigious engines with all the
extreme technicality of a new hand, and with much pride pointed
out the part whereon he (with the help of three or four
journeymen) had been at work.&nbsp; Bessy stared and marvelled,
and her admiration for her brother waxed into reverence.&nbsp;
For was he not an engineer, master of these massy, shining
immensities, so amazingly greater than any engines she had
dreamed of, so awful in their monstrous stillness?&nbsp; Bessy
peeped along the tunnel of the great shaft, and then, a minute
after, up into the towering complexities above, and she was
almost afraid&mdash;would have been afraid to stay there
alone.</p>
<p>They walked home gay and talkative, and Bessy&rsquo;s face had
a light and a colour that it had lacked since Johnny and
gran&rsquo;dad had seen it together.&nbsp; For she had <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>seen great
things, and had walked in passenger saloons more wonderful than
all her palaces of romance.&nbsp; It struck Johnny, for the first
time in his life, that Bessy was rather pretty; and as to her
lameness though some would call it a blemish (as it certainly was
a misfortune), yet she carried it trimly, and he almost thought
it suited her.</p>
<p>And so they went till at a corner a hurried little man with a
moon-face ran into them, hat first,&mdash;for he was brushing it
again.</p>
<p>Now both Johnny and Bessy wore their best clothes, and both
looked happy and well, so at a glance Uncle Isaac guessed that
things had gone aright at Harbour Lane after all.&nbsp; Just as
distress troubled and repelled him, so good fortune pleased his
amiable genius and attracted his regards.&nbsp; So though he was
still a little flushed and uneasy, he was glad of the
encounter.&nbsp; He had been unwell, it seemed, and&mdash;and
busy, and all that.&nbsp; But how was trade at the shop?</p>
<p>Johnny and Bessy told the tale of the new ship-yard gate, and
of the cold bacon and the pickles and the new prosperity.&nbsp;
Uncle Isaac was greatly pleased.&nbsp; He was sorry, very sorry,
he said, that he had not been able to call lately, but he would
delay no longer&mdash;he would be round that very evening.&nbsp;
And, indeed, he came, and immensely approved of the bacon.&nbsp;
And he came again, and approved immensely of the cheese and <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>the pickles
and whatever else there was for supper, and again after that, and
usually carried something home for trial in the calmer mood of
the morning.&nbsp; And thus family ties were made whole, and
avuncular love continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest to think,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac would say with a wave
of his fork, &ldquo;what a quantity o&rsquo; blessin&rsquo;s you
owe to my advice, Nan!&nbsp; What was my words o&rsquo; counsel
to you prefarrotory?&nbsp; &lsquo;Enterprise,&rsquo; sez I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Enterprise is what you want,&rsquo; I sez; there&rsquo;s
alwis money in Enterprise!&nbsp; An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the
result?&nbsp; Enterprise, representin&rsquo; biled &rsquo;ock
o&rsquo; bacon, is done the trick wonderful.&nbsp; But, in
regards to enterprise, why not call it &rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>XVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the spring the steady
application of paint in Harbour Lane burst into a fury.&nbsp;
Everywhere the houses and the flagstaffs and the fences took new
coats of many colours, changing as the season went, and the
paint-pot traffic fell into a vaster confusion.&nbsp; As tops
were &ldquo;in&rdquo; among the boys, the smell of paint grew day
by day, and when the marble season began little else could be
smelt.&nbsp; With July came Fairlop Friday, and Bessy wondered at
the passing of a great model of a rigged ship on wheels, drawn by
horses, and filled with jubilant shipwrights on their way to
Epping Forest, in accord with yearly custom.&nbsp; She had grown
to consider the forest as a place so far off (though indeed she
knew the distance in mere miles) that it came almost as a
surprise to see people starting out to drive there in a few hours
with so slow a vehicle, and to return the same night.</p>
<p>Bob Smallpiece had written once or twice (he kept an eye on
the empty cottage, and looked out for a tenant), but he had never
made a visit, as Nan May had asked him.&nbsp; The last news was
that his bedridden old mother was worse, and not expected to
live.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>The
trade went well&mdash;better than ever, indeed, and scarce a
month passed but Nan May put a sovereign or two in the
post-office savings bank; and Uncle Isaac began secretly to look
upon the shop in Harbour Lane as a convenient retreat for his
later years.&nbsp; Already he took as many meals there as
possible, for, as he said, he could get no proper attention in
his new lodgings.&nbsp; Of his old friend Mr. Butson he had seen
nothing for months.&nbsp; For Butson, he knew, had lost his berth
on the steamboat, and had fallen on evil times&mdash;and Uncle
Isaac never intruded on private griefs of this description.</p>
<p>But late in the year, when the anniversary of Johnny&rsquo;s
apprenticeship was nearing, and when Johnny himself was near a
head taller&mdash;for he grew quickly now&mdash;Uncle Isaac saw
Butson from afar as he crossed the docks, and Butson saw
him.&nbsp; There was no escape, but Uncle Isaac, with a grin and
a wave of the hand, tried to pass on hurriedly, as though urgent
business claimed his time.&nbsp; But Mr. Butson rose from his
bollard&mdash;bollards had been his most familiar furniture for
months now&mdash;and intercepted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad about a year now to git that
&rsquo;urry over,&rdquo; he said, with something not unlike a
sneer.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; that way,
I&rsquo;ll come along too.&nbsp; Got any &rsquo;bacca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac, with a bounteous air that scarce covered his
reluctance, pulled out a screw of paper, and Mr. <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Butson
filled his pipe.&nbsp; For some little way he smoked in silence,
for tobacco was an uncommon luxury with him just now, and he
enjoyed a succession of puffs with no interruption.&nbsp; Then he
said, &ldquo;Workin&rsquo; at Turton&rsquo;s now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac replied, with a slight
cough.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;no, I ain&rsquo;t workin&rsquo;
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought not.&nbsp; Looked out for y&rsquo; often.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; you moved too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Butson smoked again for a
space, and then went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a
pretty awful year,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why I was very
near goin&rsquo; stokin&rsquo; once or twice.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He
had not quite gone, because the chief engineer always sent him
ashore.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice thing, that, for a man o&rsquo; my
bringin&rsquo;-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on.&nbsp; Truly the bad year had left its marks on
Mr. Butson.&nbsp; The soles were three-quarters gone from his
boots, and the uppers were cracked.&nbsp; He wore a mixture of
ordinary and working clothes, frayed and greasy and torn, and he
shivered under a flimsy dungaree jacket, buttoned so close to the
neck as to hint an absence of shirt.&nbsp; His bowler hat was
weather-beaten and cracked, and the brim behind was beginning to
leave the crown because of rain-rot.</p>
<p>Presently Uncle Isaac, impelled to say something, asked,
&ldquo;Bin out all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very near.&nbsp; Got a job on a &rsquo;draulic, but the
chap <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>began jawin&rsquo; me about somethin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I
wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stand that, so I just walked
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much.&nbsp; One or two things I got on to, but they
didn&rsquo;t last.&nbsp; Know the laundry over the Cut?&nbsp;
Well they took me on there to run the engine, an&rsquo; sacked me
in a week.&nbsp; Said I was asleep!&nbsp; Measly swine.&nbsp;
Much the same at other places.&nbsp; Seemed to want to treat me
like&mdash;like any common feller.&nbsp; But I showed &rsquo;em
different to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; commented Uncle Isaac absently.&nbsp; He was
wondering which way to lead the walk, and how to take leave of
his companion.&nbsp; But his invention was at a stand, and
presently the other went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t got so
much to say as you used.&nbsp; Know any job you can put me on
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Uncle Isaac with
gloomy simplicity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Trade&rsquo;s bad&mdash;very
bad.&nbsp; I bin workin&rsquo; short time meself, an&rsquo;
standin&rsquo; auf day after day.&nbsp; Stood auf
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, lend us a bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac started, and made the space between them a foot
wider.&nbsp; &ldquo;Reely, Mr. Butson, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, make it two bob then, if you&rsquo;d
rather.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad more &rsquo;n that out
o&rsquo; me one time an&rsquo; another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but I tell you I&rsquo;m unfort&rsquo;net
meself.&nbsp; I bin standin&rsquo; auf day after
day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; to stand
auf as much as ye can now.&nbsp; Look &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Butson stood and faced Uncle Isaac.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
broke, clean broke, an&rsquo; worse.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
&rsquo;ungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s very bad,&rdquo; said Uncle
Isaac.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why not go t&rsquo; yer rich
relations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butson frowned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind them,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather try an&rsquo; tap your small
property.&nbsp; What am I to do?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m at the end of me
tether, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve tried everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;Enterprise is what you want,&rdquo; Uncle
Isaac said, being at a loss what else to recommend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Enterprise.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve recommended Enterprise
before, with wonderful results&mdash;wonderful.&nbsp;
An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; &rsquo;ow about marryin&rsquo;?&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the lan&rsquo;lady at the Mariner&rsquo;s
Arms.&nbsp; She was alwis very friendly, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a
life as ought to suit ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;G-r-r-r!&rdquo; Mr. Butson turned his head with a growl
and took to walking again, Uncle Isaac by his side.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;d want to make a potman of me,
an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;well that ain&rsquo;t much catch,
any&rsquo;ow.&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t lend me a bob, stand me a
feed o&rsquo; some sort.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad yer tea,
&rsquo;ave ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly something must be sacrificed to Butson, and it struck
Uncle Isaac that the cheapest article would be some of Nan
May&rsquo;s bacon.&nbsp; So he said, &ldquo;Well, I was
thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; poppin&rsquo; round to my niece&rsquo;s
to tea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d make ye very
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>&ldquo;Awright.&nbsp; Same niece as give us tea over in
the Forest that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yus.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s round in &rsquo;arbour
Lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lamplighter scuffled past into the thickening dusk,
leaving his sparse trail of light-spots along the dock
wall.&nbsp; The two men came through streets where little
sitting-rooms, lighted as yet by fires alone, cheered Butson with
promise of the meal to come; and when at last he stood in Nan
May&rsquo;s shop, now no place of empty boxes, but ranged close
with bacon, cheese, candles, sausages, brawn, spiced beef, many
eggs and a multitude of sundries, there was some shadow of the
old strut and sulky swagger, hanging oddly about the broken-up
Butson of these later days.</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac did it with an air, for an air was an inexpensive
embellishment that won him consideration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good-evenin&rsquo;, Nan.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve took the liberty
(which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll call it a pleasure) to
introduce a of friend to tea which we well remember with
&rsquo;appier circumstances.&nbsp; Mr. Butson is come to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duller eyes than Nan May&rsquo;s would have seen
Butson&rsquo;s fallen condition at a glance, and it afflicted her
to know that while fortune had favoured her it had stricken him
so sorely.&nbsp; She led them in, offering Butson a cordiality in
some sort exaggerated by her anxiety not to seem to see his poor
clothes, nor to treat him a whit the worse for his
ill-luck.&nbsp; As for Mr. Butson, he found a good <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>fire and a
clean hearth, with an armchair beside it, in a better room than
he had seen for long.&nbsp; Old Mr. May&rsquo;s photograph hung
over the mantelpiece, and below it was the sole remaining
butterfly trophy, a small glass case, set when the old man was
young.&nbsp; The ragged books that were Bessy&rsquo;s solace
stood on a sideboard top, and Bessy herself, disturbed in
reading, was putting one of them carefully in its place.&nbsp;
The kettle sang on the hob.&nbsp; And when Johnny came from work
he was astonished to find a tea-party of great animation.</p>
<p>Johnny was a big lad now (though he was scarce sixteen years
of age), and Mr. Butson condescended to shake hands with him, to
condole with him on the choice of the wretched trade that had so
ill supported himself, and to exchange a remark or two on the
engineering topics of the week.</p>
<p>But chiefly Mr. Butson attended to the meal.&nbsp; Nan May had
never seen two men together eat such a meal as his.&nbsp; Plainly
he was famished.&nbsp; She was full of pity for this unfortunate,
so well brought up (thought the simple soul), so cruelly
neglected by his well-to-do relations.&nbsp; She cut more slices
of bacon, and more, and still more of bread and butter, quietly
placing them to his hand, till at last he was satisfied.</p>
<p>Mr. Butson was refreshed, filled his pipe again from Uncle
Isaac&rsquo;s paper, and gave some attention to the
conversation.&nbsp; But the conversation took to itself the
property <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>of rarely travelling far from Mr. Butson and his
troubles.&nbsp; He had no false modesty about them.&nbsp; He had
parted with almost all his clothes, and hadn&rsquo;t a shirt to
his back.&nbsp; His tools were in pawn, and a man felt
discouraged from looking for a job when his tools were &ldquo;put
away,&rdquo; and he had no money to redeem them.&nbsp; But he
would starve sooner than apply to his unnatural relations; he
would take the help of strangers first.</p>
<p>When at last Mr. Butson took leave, and went shivering into
the gusty night, Uncle Isaac was careful to let him go alone, and
to remain, himself, in the shop parlour till his friend was clear
away.&nbsp; But Nan May ran down the street after her departed
guest.&nbsp; There were a few hurried words of entreaty in the
woman&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Here, Mr. Butson.&nbsp; Do! you
really must!&rdquo;&mdash;and she scurried back breathless and a
trifle shamefaced.&nbsp; She reached across the counter and shut
the till ere she came into the shop parlour.</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac Iooked up sharply in her face as she entered, but
went on with his pipe.</p>
<h2><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>XVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> visit was but the first of
many from Mr. Butson: until after a very few months he came as
regularly as Uncle Isaac himself.&nbsp; He recovered his old
appearance a little at a time, one new article of clothing coming
after another; but he seemed to have no luck in his quest for a
job&mdash;or very little.&nbsp; What small success he found was
ever brought to naught by the captiousness&mdash;even the
rudeness&mdash;of those in direction, or their unreasonable
exactions in the way of work.&nbsp; To simple Nan May he seemed
the most shamefully ill-used of exemplars.</p>
<p>Johnny and Bessy were less enthusiastic.&nbsp; Bessy said
nothing, but avoided Mr. Butson as much as possible, sitting in
the shop when he was in the back parlour.&nbsp; Johnny went for
walks in the evening, and grumbled, wondering why his mother
encouraged this stranger&mdash;&ldquo;cadging suppers,&rdquo; as
he uncivilly put it.&nbsp; Nan May was hurt at the expression,
and feared that the workshop was spoiling Johnny&rsquo;s
manners.</p>
<p>News came from Bob Smallpiece that his poor old mother was
dead at last, and buried in the high <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>churchyard where Johnny&rsquo;s
grandfather lay.&nbsp; Also that Bob would come to London now,
for a visit, at the first opportunity.&nbsp; Now it was a fact
that Bob Smallpiece, for a year or two, had been inclined to
marry; though it was a thing he might never have thought of if he
had seen less of Mrs. May.&nbsp; But he was a man of practical
temperament, making up in his commonsense for a great lack of
agility of mind.&nbsp; There were certain obstacles, he
saw&mdash;obstacles that must remove of themselves or not at
all.&nbsp; First, his old mother.&nbsp; It would not seem fair to
bring a wife to nurse a bedridden old woman&mdash;at anyrate it
was scarce an attraction.&nbsp; More, the old woman herself had a
dread of it.&nbsp; She feared the chance of being thought a
burden by a newcomer, and would often beg Bob not to marry till
she were gone; sometimes with the assurance that she would not be
long now.&nbsp; Then&mdash;to say nothing of old Mr.
May&mdash;there had been the children, who, familiar as he was
with them, afflicted him, in this particular matter alone, with
an odd shyness.&nbsp; Again, when the old man died, the May
family must needs come to London, if only that Johnny might go to
his trade; while Bob Smallpiece must stay at the forest.&nbsp;
But he was ever patient and philosophical.</p>
<p>Now that some difficulties were gone, another arose.&nbsp; Nan
May, all unaware of his slow designs, was settled in London, with
ties of business.&nbsp; But perhaps, after all, the business was
not flourishing&mdash;might be a burden <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>better laid
down.&nbsp; And as to Johnny&mdash;he was earning wages of some
sort now, and at most his apprenticeship would be out when he was
twenty-one.</p>
<p>Bob Smallpiece had reserved one piece of news till he could
deliver it in person.&nbsp; This was that at last he had let the
cottage, at three-and-sixpence a week, to a decent woodman and
his wife.&nbsp; And so, wearing a new neckcloth, and with three
weeks&rsquo; rent in his pocket, Bob Smallpiece appeared in
Harbour Lane one spring morning, a vast astonishment of leather
and velveteen, such as had never before brought a Blackwall
housewife to attention in the midst of her dusting and
sweeping.&nbsp; No name was painted over the shop, but no
stranger could pass its red and blue and green without stopping
to look; least of all Bob Smallpiece, in quest of the place
itself.&nbsp; Nan May saw him, and ran to the door; and Bessy,
with her crutch and her book, met him half-way to the
back-parlour, gay and laughing.</p>
<p>Bob regarded the well-filled shop, the neat room, with some
mixture of feelings.&nbsp; Prosperity was excellent in its own
way, but it made the new obstacle more formidable.&nbsp; Further,
Mrs. May, though she was pleased to hear that the cottage was
let, and grateful enough for his trouble in letting it, was not
so overjoyed as she might have been if the weekly
three-and-sixpence had come at a time of pinching; more, she
handled the half-sovereign almost as disrespectfully as the
sixpence, and <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>dropped it into a part of her purse where it fell among
other gold.&nbsp; Poor Bob saw the obstacle not only bigger, but
double.&nbsp; Not merely was Nan May tied to London by her trade
and by Johnny&rsquo;s apprenticeship, but she was a well-to-do
tradeswoman, with whom a poor forest-keeper could expect no more
than respectful acquaintance.&nbsp; He half feared she might even
offer to pay him for his trouble with the cottage, and grew red
and hot with the apprehension.&nbsp; But this affliction was
spared him though Nan did venture to ask if his care of her
property had involved out-of-pocket expenses; a suggestion which
Bob repudiated desperately.</p>
<p>Neither Bessy nor her mother could understand why their
visitor&rsquo;s manner was so constrained and awkward, nor why he
announced that he &ldquo;must be going&rdquo; after sitting for
twenty minutes.&nbsp; But that, of course, was not to be
allowed.&nbsp; Johnny would be home in half an hour, and there
would be some dinner.&nbsp; So Bob Smallpiece, who wanted to get
away somewhere by himself and think things over, remained, and
made his part of the conversation as well as he could.</p>
<p>Johnny came, smudgy and hungry, surprised to find that his old
friend, big man as he was, seemed to be scarcely so big as when
he saw him last, eighteen months ago.&nbsp; For Johnny himself
was grown surprisingly, and seemed like to stand as high as Bob
Smallpiece&rsquo;s shoulder by his seventeenth birthday.&nbsp;
Bob found more <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>to talk of now that Johnny had come, and he ate even
better than Johnny himself, for nothing spoiled the
keeper&rsquo;s appetite.&nbsp; When could they all come to the
forest again for a day?&nbsp; Nan May shook her head.&nbsp; She
had no days free but Sundays&mdash;she might come some day,
perhaps; some Sunday in the vague future.&nbsp; But Johnny might
get a day off at a slack time, and he and Bessy would come.&nbsp;
Bessy brimmed over with delight at the prospect.&nbsp; Every day,
since she had left it, the forest had seemed a more wonderful and
a more distant dream; every day some forgotten circumstance, some
moment of delight, some long-dead bunch of wildflowers, trifles
all, and daily commonplaces once, had come back to lend one more
touch to the fairy picture her memory made ever more radiant as
the simple facts fell farther into the past.&nbsp; And Johnny,
little burdened with pictures of fancy (for he put his
imagination away from him now, as a childishness unworthy an
engineer), nevertheless thought that as soon as a certain large
job was completed at Maidment and Hurst&rsquo;s the gaffer would
doubtless let him lose a day.&nbsp; So it was settled.&nbsp; And
when Johnny hurried off to his work, Bob Smallpiece took the
opportunity to leave too; for he must go and see his sister, he
said.</p>
<p>He went, and saw his sister, and took tea with her; and his
sister found him even duller than Nan May had done.&nbsp; For in
truth Bob Smallpiece was in a mire of <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>doubt and hesitation.&nbsp; In a
frame of mind so foreign to his simple habit he grew fretful, and
left things to chance and impulse.&nbsp; With no definite design
in the world, he wandered back to Harbour Lane after tea, and
there met, for the first time, Uncle Isaac and Mr. Butson.&nbsp;
This company proved uncongenial; and indeed the distinguished
Butson was indisposed to be cordial with an Essex bumpkin in a
velveteen uniform.&nbsp; So, though Nan May was all kindness, Bob
Smallpiece soon took himself off to the train, where his savage
moodiness might not be seen.&nbsp; The whole thing was past hope
now; though he might have found it hard to tell precisely what
had occurred since midday to worsen the look of affairs.</p>
<h2><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>XVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> for six weeks, at least, Johnny
judged, could he beg the day&rsquo;s holiday that was to take him
and Bessy back to the forest; and it might be more.&nbsp; That
would be in July&mdash;or even August&mdash;and probably the
weather would be more trustworthy then.&nbsp; As for Bessy, she
counted the days on the almanack, and tapped the yellow-faced old
barometer that had been gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s, a dozen times a
day.&nbsp; Johnny laughed at her impatience, and invented endless
weather prophecies &ldquo;just from America&rdquo; putting the
weather for the whole of July at every possible shade of
unpleasantness, from blizzards to floods and thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The days went quietly&mdash;they were even dull.&nbsp; Mr.
Butson did what he could to make himself agreeable, and several
times praised a set of callipers that Johnny had made&mdash;a set
of callipers that Johnny, in fact, thought very well of
himself.&nbsp; So that he seemed not such a bad fellow, perhaps,
after all, though a bit of a sponge.</p>
<p>There was nothing to cause it, to all seeming, but it was a
fact that just now Nan May grew thoughtful and <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>absent of
manner.&nbsp; She would pause in the midst of needlework, as
though to think; and more than once at such a time, Bessy,
looking up from her own work, saw that her mother&rsquo;s
troubled gaze was fixed on herself.&nbsp; Nan May put away the
anxious look as well as she might, and bent to her work again;
but Bessy wondered.</p>
<p>Johnny, too, fancied that his mother was scarce so cheerful as
was her wont, though he thought of it less than Bessy.&nbsp; But
one Sunday afternoon, meeting her by her bedroom door, he took
her cheeks between his palms, and looked hard in her face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve been
crying!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put a hand on each of his wrists, and made a shift to
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; she said, and
tried to pull his hands down.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
gettin&rsquo; too strong for your poor old mother to keep you in
order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she brightened, always, when Mr. Butson came in the
evening; though Mr. Butson&rsquo;s conversation scarce seemed of
so inspiriting a character as to account wholly for the
change.&nbsp; Still, it interested her.&nbsp; It was mostly about
his grievances at the hands of the world; and Nan May was a ready
sympathiser.</p>
<p>It was very near to the day (at last fixed) for the excursion,
when Bessy woke in the night at the striking of a match.&nbsp;
Her mother was lighting a candle, her back toward the bed.&nbsp;
She took the candle and passed out, into Johnny&rsquo;s room at
the back.&nbsp; Bessy listened, but she <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>heard no
talk; heard nothing, indeed, but Johnny&rsquo;s heavy breathing,
so still was the night.&nbsp; Presently her mother returned, and
stood over her, still with the candle; gazing on her face, it
seemed to Bessy&mdash;as well as she could see through her
half-closed eyes&mdash;much as she had gazed when she paused in
her needlework, though now her cheeks were wet with tears.&nbsp;
With that Bessy opened wide her eyes, and &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Are you
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan May turned and blew out the light.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Bess,
no; I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she said, and crept into
bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not&mdash;not much.&nbsp; I woke up,
that&rsquo;s all&mdash;with a bad dream.&rdquo;&nbsp; She kissed
the girl, and put her arm about her neck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been a good girl, Bessy,&rdquo; she
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t turn against me, would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, mother!&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not whatever happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;of course not,&rdquo; she kissed her mother
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&nbsp; Only the dream&mdash;just the
dream, Bess.&nbsp; Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>XIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> longed-for holiday came with a
fine Monday morning, and Bessy, in a muslin frock that her mother
had helped to make for the occasion, was impatient, an hour too
soon, because Johnny lingered in bed; enjoying the luxury of
&ldquo;losing a quarter&rdquo; without paying the penalty.</p>
<p>But Johnny was ready for breakfast before eight, and, seeing
the shop-door open, ran to take down the shutters, a thing his
mother commonly did herself, because of his absence at
work.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always put &rsquo;em up, and for once
I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em down,&rdquo; he said, prancing in with
the first.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look out, mother, or I&rsquo;ll bowl you
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, Johnny,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;leave
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll only have to&mdash;&rdquo; and at
that she stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only have to what?&rdquo; Johnny asked, going for
another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only have to serve the customers, eh,
&rsquo;cause the shop&rsquo;s open?&nbsp; Of course you
will&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t <i>your</i> holiday, you
know&mdash;it&rsquo;s ours!&nbsp; Look out again!&nbsp;
Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessy rattled at the old barometer still, though for half an
hour it had refused to move its hand a shade; <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>and she
asked Johnny for the fiftieth time if he were perfectly sure that
the proper train wasn&rsquo;t earlier than they were
supposing.&nbsp; And when at last Johnny admitted that it was
time to start, Nan May kissed them and bade them good-bye with so
wistful an earnestness that Johnny was moved to pleasantry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All right, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
coming back some day you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were scarce half-way to the railway-station when Bessy
said: &ldquo;Johnny, I don&rsquo;t think mother&rsquo;s been very
well lately.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be another train soon; shall we
go back an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; just see if she&rsquo;s all
right, first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea!&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; then I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;d
better miss the next, an&rsquo; go back to see how she&rsquo;s
getting on then, an&rsquo; the one after that, eh?&nbsp;
Mother&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been thinking a bit
about&mdash;you know, gran&rsquo;dad an&rsquo; all that; and
because we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to the forest it reminds her of
it.&nbsp; Come on&mdash;don&rsquo;t begin the day with
dumps!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There was interest for both of them in the railway
journey.&nbsp; They changed trains at Stepney, and after a
station or two more came in distant sight of a part of the road
they had traversed, on Bank&rsquo;s cart, when they came to
London, two winters back.&nbsp; There was the great, low,
desolate wilderness, treeless and void of any green thing, seen
now from nearer the midst, with the road <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>bounding it
in the distance; and here was the chemical manure-factory, close
at hand this time, with its stink at short-hitting range, so that
every window in the train went up with a bang, and everybody in
the long third-class carriage coughed, or grimaced, or spat, or
swore, according to sex and habit.</p>
<p>Then, out beyond Stratford, through Leyton and Leytonstone,
they saw that the town had grown much in twenty months, and was
still growing.&nbsp; Close, regular streets of little houses, all
of one pattern, stared in raw brick, or rose, with a forlorn air
of crumbling sponginess, amid sparse sticks of scaffolding.&nbsp;
Bessy wondered how the butterflies were faring in the forest, and
how much farther they had been driven since she left it.&nbsp;
Then the wide country began to spin past, and pleasant single
houses, and patches of wood.&nbsp; The hills about Chigwell stood
bright and green across the Roding valley, as the low ground ran
away between, and the high forest land came up at the other side
of the line.&nbsp; Till the train stood in Loughton Station.</p>
<p>Through the village Bessy, flushed and eager, stumped and
swung at a pace that kept Johnny walking his best.&nbsp; Staple
Hill was the nearest corner of the forest, and for Staple Hill
they made direct.&nbsp; Once past the street-end it rose before
them, round and gay, deep and green in the wood that clothed
it.&nbsp; Boys were <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>fishing in the pond at its foot, and
the stream ran merrily under the dusty road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Johnny!&rdquo; Bessy cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Straight
over the hill!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor did she check her pace till the
wide boughs shaded them, and her crutch went softly on the mossy
earth among old leaves.&nbsp; Then she stood and laughed aloud,
and was near crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Smell it, Johnny!&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;smell it!&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it heavenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up the slope, across tiny glades, and between thick
clumps of undergrowth gay with dog-roses, Bessy&rsquo;s eyes and
ears alert for everything, tree, bird, or flower; now spying out
some noisy jay that upbraided their intrusion, now standing to
hark for a distant woodpecker.&nbsp; Johnny enjoyed the walk too,
but with a soberer delight; as became an engineer taking a
day&rsquo;s relaxation amid the scenes of childish play now half
forgotten.</p>
<p>Down the other side of the hill they went, and over the
winding stream at the bottom.&nbsp; Truly it seemed a tiny stream
now, and Johnny wondered that he should ever have been proud of
jumping it.&nbsp; He found a bend where the water rushed through
a narrow channel by the side of a bed of clean-washed gravel, and
got Bess across, though she scrambled down and up with little
help, such was her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Then the trees grew sparser, and over the deep-grown flat of
Debden Slade Bessy stopped again and <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>again to recognise some
well-remembered wild-flower; and little brown butterflies skimmed
over the rushes and tall grass, the sun mounted higher, and
everything was brisk and bright and sweet-smelling.&nbsp; Brother
and sister climbed the hill before them slowly, often staying to
look back over the great prospect of rolling woodland, ever
widening as they rose.&nbsp; Till at last they stood at the point
of the ridge, in the gap through the earthwork made by ancient
Britons.</p>
<p>This beyond all others was the spot that Bessy had loved
best.&nbsp; This ragged ring of crumbling rampart and ditch,
grown thick with fantastic hornbeams, pollarded out of all common
shape; its inner space a crowded wonder of tall bracken, with
rare patches of heather; its outer angles watching over the
silent woods below, and dominating the hills that ranked beyond;
this was the place where best an old book from the shelf would
fill a sunny afternoon.&nbsp; For the camp was a romance in
itself, a romance of closer presence than anything printed on
paper.&nbsp; Here, two thousand years ago, the long-haired
savages had stood, in real fact, with spears and axes,
brandishing defiance to foes on the hillside.&nbsp; Here they had
entrenched themselves against the Roman legions&mdash;they and
their chief, fierce Cassivellaunus: more, to her, than a name in
an old history-book.&nbsp; For had not she seen the wild prince a
hundred times in her day-dreams, stalking under the <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>oaks&mdash;with the sheeted Druids?&nbsp; Till the wood
grew alive with phantoms, and she hid her face in her book.</p>
<p>And now she sat here again, in the green shade, and looked out
over the thousand tree-tops, merry with the sunlight.&nbsp; How
long had she left it all?&nbsp; What was that fancy of a ride to
London, of ship-yards, and of a chandler&rsquo;s-shop?&nbsp; But
Johnny whistled to a robin on a twig, and she turned and looked
at him, to see that here was the engineer, indeed, and the
painter of the chandler&rsquo;s-shop.&nbsp; Still, which was the
dream, that or this?</p>
<p>Left alone, Bessy would have sat here all the day.&nbsp; But
there were other places not to be forgotten, as Johnny reminded
her.&nbsp; Over the heather they went, then, to Monk Wood, where
the trees were greater and the flowers were more abundant than
anywhere else in the forest; and they did not leave it till
Johnny insisted on dinner.&nbsp; Now this dinner was a great
excitement; for at setting out Johnny had repelled every
suggestion of sandwiches in a bag, and now dauntlessly marched
into an inn on the main road and ordered whatever was ready, with
two glasses of beer.&nbsp; Bessy, overwhelmed by the audacity of
the act, nevertheless preserved her appetite, and even drank a
little of the beer.&nbsp; And the adventure cost Johnny four
shillings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s having her dinner alone,&rdquo; said
Bessy in a <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>flutter of timid delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
doesn&rsquo;t guess we&rsquo;re having ours at the Red
Deer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence it was not far, by the lanes, to the high churchyard,
for the flowers gathered in Monk Wood were for
gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s grave, and it was a duty of the day to
mark the condition of the little headstone.&nbsp; All was well
with it, and it surprised them to find the grass cut neatly, and
a little clump of pansies growing on the mound.&nbsp; Bessy
suspected Bob Smallpiece.</p>
<p>And so went a perfect day.&nbsp; Their tea they took in Bob
Smallpiece&rsquo;s lodge.&nbsp; The keeper admitted having
&ldquo;gone over&rdquo; old Mr. May&rsquo;s grave with the grass
shears&mdash;just once or twice.&nbsp; He avoided making any
definite reply to Johnny&rsquo;s and Bessy&rsquo;s invitations to
come to Harbour Lane again.&nbsp; Perhaps he&rsquo;d come again,
he said, some day.&nbsp; Meanwhile, had they seen the
cottage?&nbsp; As they had not, they set out all three together,
and looked at it.</p>
<p>The new tenancy had made little change.&nbsp; Down the glen
the white walls first peeped from among the trunks, and then the
red tiles, just as ever.&nbsp; The woodman was at work mending
the old fence&mdash;it was always being mended somewhere.&nbsp;
The turbulent little garden still tumbled and surged against it,
threatening to lay it flat at any moment.&nbsp; Very naturally,
the woodman and his wife, though perfectly civil, took less
personal interest in Johnny and Bessy than Johnny and Bessy took
in <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>them
and the cottage, so that it was not long ere a last look was
taken at the old fence, and Bob Smallpiece went off another way
on his walk of duty.</p>
<p>Shadows grew long, and thickets dark.&nbsp; To revisit every
remembered nook had been impossible, but they had seen and
lingered in all them that had most delighted Bessy in old
times&mdash;all but Wormleyton Pits.&nbsp; Johnny had turned that
way once, thoughtlessly; but &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bessy
said&mdash;almost whispered&mdash;with her hand on his arm,
&ldquo;not that way, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now they turned their backs on the fast darkening forest
and took a steep lane for the village below.&nbsp; The sweet
smells, that go up at the first blink of the evening star, met
them on the breeze; and when they turned for their last look
toward the woods, the trees on the hill-top, tall sentinels of
the host beyond, barred the red west and nodded them and the sun
goodbye.</p>
<p>Out of the stony lane, Loughton was lighted, and at the end of
a dusty road was a small constellation of gas-lamps and railway
signals.&nbsp; Now it was plain that both were a little
tired&mdash;Bessy perhaps more than a little.&nbsp; But the train
gave a welcome rest, and there were no passengers to see, even if
she slept, for they were alone in their compartment.&nbsp; They
had passed two stations, when Johnny, who had been standing to
look out at the opposite window, turned and saw that his <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>sister was
dozing, with her head bent forward and her face hidden by the
crutch-handle.&nbsp; It was so wholly her figure as she sat in
the cab at the old man&rsquo;s funeral, that Johnny started, and
sat where he stood, though he had never once called the thing to
mind since that day.&nbsp; And he took the crutch gently away, to
look at her face.&nbsp; But it was calm and untroubled; and he
put his hand at the farther side of it and pressed it to his
shoulder; for plainly she was tired out, and there were no
cushions in the carriage.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was nearing ten o&rsquo;clock when at last they turned into
Harbour Lane.&nbsp; From a back street came the old
watchman&rsquo;s cry, &ldquo;Pa-a-ast nine o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;
as he went his round in search of orders to wake early risers;
and lights in bedroom windows told of early risers already
seeking sleep.&nbsp; Nobody was in the shop, but as they came in,
Johnny thought he saw his mother&rsquo;s face vanish from beside
the muslin curtain that obscured the glass in the back-parlour
door.</p>
<p>They passed through the shop, and into the back parlour.&nbsp;
Their mother and Mr. Butson sat facing them, side by side.&nbsp;
Mr. Butson had a new suit of clothes, and their mother wore her
best, and smiles and tears were in her face.&nbsp; Something had
happened.&nbsp; What was it?&nbsp; Bessy and Johnny, scarce
within the door, stood and stared.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&ldquo;Johnny&mdash;Bessy&mdash;&rdquo; Nan faltered,
looking from one to the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
you&mdash;enjoyed your holiday? . . . Won&rsquo;t you&mdash;kiss
me, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and made a step toward them.&nbsp; But something
struck them still, and they looked, wondering, from Nan to
Butson, and back to their mother again. . . .&nbsp; What was
it?</p>
<p>Johnny moved first, and kissed his mother, absently, gazing at
Mr. Butson the while.&nbsp; Mr. Butson, who was smoking, said
nothing, but lay back in his chair and considered the ash of his
cigar.</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s anxiety was plain to see.&nbsp; She put a hand on
Johnny&rsquo;s shoulder and an arm on Bessy&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I,&mdash;we&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be vexed because I
didn&rsquo;t tell you, will you?&rdquo; she said, pale, but
trying to smile, &ldquo;I&mdash;we&mdash;Mr. Butson . . . Johnny,
Bessy&mdash;don&rsquo;t look so!&rdquo;&nbsp; Tears ran down her
cheeks, and she bent her head on Johnny&rsquo;s other
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been married
to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>XX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shock left Johnny and Bessy
numb, and, though Bessy was quicker, the change took Johnny two
or three days to realise&mdash;even to understand.&nbsp; His
first distinct impression was one of injury and resentment.&nbsp;
He had been tricked&mdash;hoodwinked.&nbsp; His mother&mdash;even
his mother had deceived him and Bessy.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Why not
tell them first?</p>
<p>She <i>would</i> have told them, he was sure; she told them
everything.&nbsp; Butson had persuaded her to keep them in
ignorance till the thing was done, lest they should rebel, and
perhaps bring her to a change of mood.&nbsp; And Johnny&rsquo;s
guess was a good one. . . .&nbsp; Forthwith his resentment became
something more; hate, mere hate for this man who had come between
him and his mother&mdash;this cadger of suppers thrusting himself
into their intimate life. . . .</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;perhaps this was simple anger at the slight and
the deception; jealousy at finding a stranger as dear to his
mother as himself was.&nbsp; Butson might turn out none so bad a
fellow.&nbsp; He was very decent over the callipers, for
instance. . . .&nbsp; Curse the callipers!&nbsp; <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>Johnny&rsquo;s anger was not to be reasoned down.&nbsp;
On Sunday he had his own mother.&nbsp; Now there was nothing but
Butson&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>More, the man was his father&mdash;his stepfather; chief
authority in the house, with respect and obedience due to
him.&nbsp; That seemed intolerable.&nbsp; For a moment Johnny had
mad notions of leaving home altogether, and shifting for
himself&mdash;going aboard ship, abroad, anywhere.&nbsp; But that
would be to leave Bess alone&mdash;and his mother; his mother
might need him yet.</p>
<p>He told Long Hicks, as they tramped to work over the locks and
bridges in the bright morning, early and still; and it surprised
him to see Hicks&rsquo;s tacit concern at the news.&nbsp; The
long man reddened and stuttered, and checked himself suddenly at
an imminent outburst of speech.&nbsp; But that was all; he
offered no opinion and made no remark; and as he was given to
suppressed excitement on small occasion, Johnny presently forgot
it.</p>
<p>As for Bessy, her distress, quiet as it was, was beyond
telling.&nbsp; Her association with her mother had been so
intimate that this change was stark bereavement; and for Butson
and his coarse pretence her feeling was sheer repulsion.</p>
<p>Neither boy nor girl had the habit of dissimulation, and
though they said little, it needed small discernment to guess
something of their sentiments.&nbsp; Poor Nan was <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>dismayed to
perceive that they did not take to Butson instant on the news of
the novel relationship.&nbsp; Indeed, it perplexed her.&nbsp; For
in her simple view he was a resplendent person of finer mould,
sore hit by a cruel world, and entitled to the respectful
sympathy, at least and coldest, of the merest stranger.&nbsp;
More, nobody could be more completely devoted than he to the
interests of Johnny and Bessy; he had most vehemently assured her
of it, again and again.&nbsp; But after all, the thing was
sudden; they must realise his true worth soon.&nbsp; Though
meantime she was distressed extremely.</p>
<p>Butson saw plainly enough, but for the present cared not at
all.&nbsp; He had won his game, and for a little time unwonted
plenty and comfort satisfied him.&nbsp; Though he was not
insensible that this was a place wherein he must do something
more to make himself absolute master.</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac got the news on Tuesday evening, when he came for
supper.&nbsp; For a week or ten days he had been little seen at
Harbour Lane, because of an urgent job involving overtime, a
thing not to be neglected in these lean years.&nbsp; He had
suspected nothing, moreover, supposing Butson to be so often
attracted to Nan&rsquo;s by the mere prospect of supper.</p>
<p>Now, when he was told, he was near as astonished as Johnny had
been.&nbsp; He sat at random&mdash;fortunately on a
chair&mdash;and opened mouth and eyes.&nbsp; But ere his <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>mouth
closed he had resolved on his own course.&nbsp; The thing was
done, and past undoing.</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet, and seized one of Butson&rsquo;s
hands&mdash;the nearest&mdash;in both his own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Butson!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Butson!&nbsp; Me ole friend
&rsquo;Enery&mdash;me dearest &rsquo;opes an&rsquo; wishes is
rewarded.&nbsp; Nan, you&rsquo;re done most dootiful the
confidentialest o&rsquo; my intentions.&nbsp; For what was my
confidential intentions?&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere, I says, confidential
to meself, &rsquo;ere is my niece, a young woman as I wish every
possible good fortun&rsquo; to, though I sez it meself: a very
sootable young woman o&rsquo; some little property with two
children an&rsquo; a business.&nbsp; Two children an&rsquo; a
business was my reflection.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more,
&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s my very respected friend Butson&mdash;than
which none more so&mdash;fash&rsquo;nable by &rsquo;abit
an&rsquo; connexions, with no children an&rsquo; no
business.&nbsp; Them considerations bein&rsquo; thus what
follers?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the cause an&rsquo; pediment to
&rsquo;oly matrimony?&nbsp; Far be it from me, sez I, to
dictate.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;im in to tea,
any&rsquo;ow.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do whatever else is
ne&rsquo;ssry.&nbsp; Yus, I&rsquo;ll do it, sez I, as is my
dooty.&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> work it if it&rsquo;s mortal
possible.&nbsp; Whether grateful or not <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> do
it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac punched his left palm with his right fist, and
looked from husband to wife, with the eye of the righteous
defying censure.&nbsp; Nan flushed and smiled, and indeed she was
relieved.&nbsp; No consideration of her unaccustomed secrecy had
given her more doubt than <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>that it must shut her off from Uncle
Isaac&rsquo;s advice; loss enough in itself, and probably an
offence to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Uncle Isaac went on, taking his chair once
more and drawing it up to the table: &ldquo;this is a great
an&rsquo; &rsquo;appy occasion, an&rsquo; as sich it should be
kep&rsquo; up.&nbsp; Nan, is there sich a thing as a drop
o&rsquo; sperrits in the &rsquo;ouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was most of a small jar of whisky&mdash;the first
purchase Mr. Butson had caused on his change of condition.&nbsp;
It was brought, with tumblers, and Uncle Isaac celebrated the
occasion with full honours and much fragmentary
declamation.&nbsp; He drank the health of bride and bridegroom,
first separately and then together.&nbsp; He drank the health of
the family, completed and adorned by the addition of
Butson.&nbsp; He drank success to the shop; long life to all the
parties concerned; happiness to each of them.&nbsp; And a certain
forgetfulness ensuing, he began his toast-list afresh, in
conscientious precaution lest something had been omitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See there, Bess; see there, me gal,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, with some thickness of utterance, turning to Bessy
(whose one desire was to remain unnoticed), and making a
semicircular swing of the arm in Butson&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yer father!&nbsp; Noo s-stepfather!&nbsp; Local
p&rsquo;rentis!&nbsp; As a cripple an&rsquo; a burden it&rsquo;s
your dooty to be grateful for the c-circumstance.&nbsp;
Bein&rsquo; a widderer o&rsquo; long ex-experience <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>meself
I&rsquo;m grateful for s-surroundin&rsquo; priv&rsquo;leges,
which it is your dooty t&rsquo; respeck.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Dooty
t&rsquo; respeck an&rsquo; obey; likewise honour.&nbsp;
&rsquo;C-cos if shillun don&rsquo; &rsquo;speck an&rsquo;
&rsquo;bey whash good C-catechism?&nbsp; Eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; Uncle
Isaac&rsquo;s voice grew loud and fierce.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whash
become C-catechishm I say?&nbsp; Nullavoid.&nbsp;
Ca&rsquo;chishm&rsquo;s nullavoid.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; Here,
pausing to look round at Mr. and Mrs. Butson, he lost his
argument altogether, and stared owlishly at the wall. . . .&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Owsomedever, the &rsquo;casion bein&rsquo; the
state an&rsquo; pediment o&rsquo; &rsquo;oly matrimony,
&rsquo;cordin&rsquo; to confidential &rsquo;tentions,
nothin&rsquo; remains but ashk you all join me &rsquo;n
drinkin&rsquo;&mdash;d-drinkin&rsquo;&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;lil&rsquo;
drop more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac subsided with his face on the table, and his eyes
closed.&nbsp; So that it grew necessary for Mr. Butson to shake
him and bring him to a perpendicular.&nbsp; Whereupon, being duly
invested with his hat, he was safely set in his way on the narrow
pavement of Harbour Lane.</p>
<h2><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>XXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Twice</span> or thrice more Uncle Isaac
came to supper, though he was dimly aware that his visits were in
some way less successful than had been their wont; insomuch that
he took nothing home with him for breakfast, nor even went so far
as to hint his desire, in Butson&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; For
Butson welcomed him not at all, and his manner grew shorter at
each meeting, and this with full intent.&nbsp; Because Mr. Butson
perceived that, as first step toward being master in his own
house, he must get rid of Uncle Isaac.</p>
<p>Mere curtness of manner&mdash;even gruffness&mdash;would never
drive Uncle Isaac from his prey.&nbsp; It operated only to make
him more voluble, more strenuously blandiloquent.&nbsp; Till one
evening after supper, as he lay back in his chair sucking noisily
at lips and teeth, he resolved to venture a step in the matter of
the lapsed grants in aid of breakfast.&nbsp; Johnny and Bessy
were out of the house (they went out more often now), Nan was
serving in the shop, and Mr. Butson sat with his back partly
turned, and smoked, in uncivil silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; quoth Uncle Isaac, with a side-glance at his
<a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>ungracious host, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a uncommon nice
tin o&rsquo; spiced beef we just &rsquo;ad a cut auf.&nbsp;
Uncommon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butson made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great credit to your business instinks,
that tin o&rsquo; spiced beef.&nbsp; I almost wish I &rsquo;ad
took another slice or so, now.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a fact, Uncle
Isaac had not been offered a further helping&mdash;perhaps
because he had already taken three.&nbsp; &ldquo;I almost wish I
&rsquo;ad. . . .&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll do another
time. . . .&nbsp; Come now, I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;alf a mind to get
Nan to wrop it up for my breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion was made as of a novel and striking idea, but
Mr. Butson showed no flash of enthusiasm.&nbsp; He swung his
chair slowly round on one leg till he faced Uncle Isaac.&nbsp;
Then he put his cigar carefully on the mantelpiece and
said:&mdash;&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere, Mr. Mundy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sudden severity of the voice drew Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s eyes
from the ceiling and his feet from under the table
simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere, Mr. Mundy!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re bin so
very kind as to celebrate this &rsquo;ere weddin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
mine with four good &rsquo;eavy suppers an&rsquo; about a pint
o&rsquo; whisky at my expense.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very grateful for
that, an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t trouble you no more.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; This is the end o&rsquo; the celebration.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to eat my supper in future, me an&rsquo; my
wife, <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>without your assistance; an&rsquo; breakfast too.&nbsp;
Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s feet retreated under his chair, and his
eyes advanced to an alarming protrusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I mean?&rdquo; Butson went on, with growing
offence in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jest you buy yer own suppers
an&rsquo; eat &rsquo;em at &rsquo;ome, or else go
without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speech was denied Uncle Isaac.&nbsp; He blinked and
choked.&nbsp; What did it mean?&nbsp; Was it a dream?&nbsp; Was
he Uncle Isaac, respected and deferred to, the man of judgment
and influence, and was he told, thus outrageously, to buy his own
supper?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yus,&rdquo; said Butson, as though in answer to his
thoughts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat Uncle Isaac, with a gasp and a roll of the eyes, found
his tongue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Butson!&rdquo; he said, in a voice
of dignified but grieved surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Butson!&nbsp;
I&mdash;I think I must &rsquo;a &rsquo;eard wrong.&nbsp;
Otherwise I might put it as you may be sorry for sich
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps,&rdquo; remarked Butson, cynically
laconic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case,&rdquo; replied Uncle Isaac the adroit,
&ldquo;it is freely took as auffered, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;
more need be said atween of friends after sich &rsquo;ansome
apologies give an&rsquo; took, and reconciliation resooms its
&rsquo;armony accordin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butson glared.&nbsp; &ldquo;G-r-r-r!&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Apologies!&nbsp; What I say I mean.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
done very well at cheap <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>suppers an&rsquo; what not
&rsquo;ere, and to-night you&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad yer last.&nbsp;
<i>I&rsquo;m</i> master &rsquo;ere now.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you can
git out as soon as ye like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git out.&nbsp; Y&rsquo;ought to be ashamed o&rsquo;
yourself,&rdquo; cried the disinterested Butson indignantly,
&ldquo;comin cadgin&rsquo; suppers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git out?&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; Suppers?&nbsp; Why,
&rsquo;Enery Butson, I brought you &rsquo;ere out o&rsquo; the
gutter!&nbsp; Out o&rsquo; the gutter, an&rsquo; fed
ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;a lot you fed me, and mighty anxious to do it,
wasn&rsquo;t ye?&nbsp; You clear out o&rsquo;
&rsquo;ere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I&rsquo;ll go! an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll see about
countermandin&rsquo; a paper or two &rsquo;fore I go to bed,
too.&nbsp; An&rsquo; my small property&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer small property!&rdquo; put in Butson, with slow
scorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yer small property!&nbsp; Where is it?&nbsp;
What is it? . . .&nbsp; Want to know my opinion o&rsquo;
you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a old &rsquo;umbug.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what you are.&nbsp; A old &rsquo;umbug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Isaac grew furious and purple.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Umbug?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Umbug?&nbsp; Them words to me, as saved ye from
starvation?&nbsp; &rsquo;Umbug yerself.&nbsp; You an&rsquo; yer
connexions, an&rsquo; mayors an&rsquo; what not!&nbsp; Why, ye
dunno yer own trade!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t trust ye to grind a
cawfy-mill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the shop-door opened, and Nan stood between
them.&nbsp; She had heard high voices, and at the first cessation
of custom she came to see.&nbsp; &ldquo;Uncle!&nbsp; <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Henry!&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo; she asked, with alarm
in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what it is,&rdquo; said Butson, now near as
purple as Uncle Isaac.&nbsp; &ldquo;This &rsquo;ere uncle
o&rsquo; yours, Mrs. Butson, or whatever &rsquo;e is, ain&rsquo;t
comin&rsquo; &rsquo;ere cadgin&rsquo; &rsquo;is grub any more;
not so long as I got a say in it &rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; So now you better say good-bye to &rsquo;im if ye want
to, &rsquo;cos &rsquo;e&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;, quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yus,&rdquo; said Uncle Isaac, speaking to his niece,
but glaring at Butson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;, Mrs.
Butson.&nbsp; An&rsquo; much better may you be for it.&nbsp;
After what I done for you an&rsquo; all.&nbsp; Sort o&rsquo;
gratitood I might &rsquo;a&rsquo; expected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O uncle!&rdquo; exclaimed the distracted Nan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, whatever&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; I know
you&rsquo;ve always been very good.&nbsp; Henry!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About puttin&rsquo; a end to this &rsquo;ere
bloodsuckin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bloodsuckin&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Isaac.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yus, you know somethin&rsquo; about that!&nbsp; Pity ye
don&rsquo;t know yer trade &rsquo;alf as well!&nbsp; Then
p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;d earn yer livin&rsquo;, &rsquo;stead
o&rsquo; spongin&rsquo; on people an&rsquo; deloodin&rsquo; a
fool of a woman to keep ye lazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo; commanded Butson, with increasing
wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, uncle, stop a minute,&rdquo; entreated poor
Nan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Henry, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
quarrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>&ldquo;O yus, I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; P&rsquo;raps
you&rsquo;d like to call the p&rsquo;lice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butson caught breath at the word, and something crossed his
face like a chance reflection from a white screen.&nbsp; But he
repeated, &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; with a gesture toward the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yus, yus!&rdquo; said Uncle Isaac, with his hat on his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;!&nbsp; An&rsquo; not
sorry neither.&nbsp; Ho!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a bright sort for a
local p&rsquo;rentis, you are!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Uncle Isaac may have
been at odds with the phrase <i>in loco parentis</i>).&nbsp;
&ldquo;A uncommon neat pattern!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he walked out
into the dark street, a small model of offended dignity.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;O Henry,&rdquo; cried Nan in tears, &ldquo;what have
you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; answered Butson, reaching for
his cigar, &ldquo;jist what I meant to do.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; &rsquo;Cos it suited me.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan felt the coarse overbearance of his stare, and dropped her
gaze beneath it.&nbsp; And with that misgiving fell upon her: the
shadow her punishment flung before it.</p>
<h2><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>XXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henry Butson</span> had fallen on good
fortune.&nbsp; No more would he endure the humiliation of begging
a job of an unsympathetic gaffer.&nbsp; In future his life would
be one of ease, free from ignoble exertion and unshamed by
dungaree overalls.&nbsp; And he made it so.&nbsp; For a little
while, his wife seemed to indulge in an absurd expectation that
he would resume his search for occupation of one sort or
another.&nbsp; Once she even hinted it, but he soon demolished
that fancy, and in terms that prevented any more hints.&nbsp; He
had little patience with such foolishness, indeed.&nbsp; The
matter was simple enough.&nbsp; Why did a man work?&nbsp; Merely
to get shelter and food and clothes and comfort, and hair-oil,
whatever he wanted to drink and smoke, and his necessary
pocket-money.&nbsp; A man who could get these things without
working would be a fool to work; more, he would behave inhumanly
to his fellow man by excluding him from a job.&nbsp; As for
himself, he got what he needed easily enough, without the trouble
of even taking down the shop-shutters: a vulgar act repellent to
his nature.</p>
<p>So he rose at ten, or eleven, or twelve, as the case might be,
and donned fine raiment; the most fashionable <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>suit
procurable from the most fashionable shop in Aldgate.&nbsp; He
began at Aldgate; but in time he grew more fastidious, and went
to a tailor in Leadenhall Street, a tailor whose daily task was
to satisfy the tastes of the most particular among the
ship-brokers&rsquo; clerks of St. Mary Axe.&nbsp; His toilet
complete, his curls well oiled, Mr. Butson descended to a
breakfast of solitary state&mdash;Nan&rsquo;s had been hurried
over hours ago.&nbsp; The rest of the day was given as occasion
prompted.&nbsp; When the weather was fine, nothing pleased him
better, nor more excellently agreed with his genteel
propensities, than to go for a stroll up West.&nbsp; When Harbour
Lane was quiet and empty (he seemed to choose such times for
going out) he would slip round to the station, and by train and
omnibus gain the happy region.&nbsp; He was careful to take with
him enough money to secure some share of the polite
gratifications proper to the quarter, and minutely acquainted
himself with the manners and customs of all the bars in the
Strand and about Piccadilly Circus.&nbsp; And although he was a
little astonished when first he was charged eighteenpence for an
American drink, he was careful not to show it, and afterwards
secretly congratulated himself on the refined instinct that had
pitched on so princely a beverage in the dark, so to speak.&nbsp;
He took air, too, in Hyde Park, to the great honour of his
whiskers, and much improved his manner of leaning on a rail and
of sitting in a green chair.&nbsp; In the evening <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>he tried,
perhaps, a music hall, but always some of the bars, and arrived
home at night rather late, sometimes a trifle unsteady, and
usually in a bad temper.&nbsp; Bad temper was natural, indeed, in
the circumstances; after so many hours&rsquo; indulgence in the
delights of fashionable society it revolted his elegant nature to
have to return at last to a vulgar little chandler&rsquo;s-shop
in a riverside street, where a wife in a print bodice and a white
apron was sitting up for him; sometimes even crying&mdash;for
nothing at all&mdash;as if the circumstances were not depressing
enough for him already.</p>
<p>These little excursions cost money, of course, but then what
was the good of keeping an ignoble little shop if you
couldn&rsquo;t get money out of it?&nbsp; And the shop did very
well.&nbsp; Mrs. Butson and the girl&mdash;the cripple&mdash;were
boiling bacon (the smell was disgusting) all day long, and they
sold it as fast as it was cold.&nbsp; And other things sold
excellently too.&nbsp; From the time when she took the shutters
down in the morning to the time when the lad Johnny put them up
at night, Mrs. Butson was unceasingly at work
serving&mdash;unless she were boiling&mdash;and scarce had five
minutes for her meals; and often the girl had to leave the bacon
and help in the shop too.&nbsp; Very well&mdash;all that meant
profit.&nbsp; The woman couldn&rsquo;t make him believe that it
didn&rsquo;t, merely because the wretched details of trade failed
to interest him.&nbsp; That was the way of people in that class
of life&mdash;there was a <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>touch of the miser about all of
them.&nbsp; No matter how the money came in, they persisted in
their narrow views as to spending it.&nbsp; And there was other
income, in addition.&nbsp; The lad Johnny&mdash;he was almost a
man to look at&mdash;brought his mother eight shillings a week at
the time of the wedding, and then ten shillings, and then twelve;
more, it would increase two shillings a year; but in truth his
mother was unduly extravagant in buying him clothes.&nbsp; Still
at anyrate there was something, and there might be more if only
Mrs. Butson would turn the girl out to earn a little, instead of
letting her waste her time reading, and confirming her in habits
of idleness.&nbsp; And there was the rent from the cottage.&nbsp;
This came every week by postal order from Bob Smallpiece, and
since it was fitting that a husband should open letters sent his
wife by a single man, Mr. Butson cashed the orders without
troubling her in the matter at all.</p>
<p>So that indeed he was not at all wasteful, considering both
his income and the society he moved in&mdash;for he was not slow
in making acquaintances among the affable gentility of the
bars.&nbsp; In fact he would have done it cheaper still but for
the pestilent uncertainty of Spring Handicaps.&nbsp; It would
seem impossible for him to put half a sovereign on any horse
without dooming it to something very near the last place.&nbsp;
The distinguished society of the bars was profoundly astonished,
indeed distressed, at his ill-luck; but gave him more excellent
<a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>information for future events; information, however,
that brought even worse luck with it.</p>
<p>His wife showed no sympathy for his troubles&mdash;and of
course there are vexations and disappointments (such as those of
the Spring Handicaps) which are inseparable from fashionable
life&mdash;but rather aggravated them with hole-and-corner
snivelling, and ridiculous attempts at persuading him to a mean
and inglorious way of life.&nbsp; She even hinted vulgar
suspicion of his west-end friends, and suggested that he should
associate with a long fool called Hicks, living next door&mdash;a
common working man.&nbsp; For a long time&mdash;many months in
fact&mdash;he bore it with what patience he might, retaliating
only in such terms as seemed necessary to close her mouth, and to
convince her of his contempt for her low habit of mind, and
indeed, for herself; and when at last it grew plain that personal
punching was what was needed, he was so considerate as not to
punch her about the face, where marks would advertise the state
of his domestic affairs; careful, also, to operate not other than
quietly, when they were alone, on the same grounds of
decency.&nbsp; And he knew that she would tell nobody, for at
least she had self-respect enough for that.</p>
<p>Of these things Johnny knew nothing, and Bessy only a
little.&nbsp; Both were glad that their stepfather was so much
from home, and though Johnny&rsquo;s sentiment <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>toward him
was a mere sullen contempt, the lad made no parade of the
fact,&mdash;rather aimed indeed at keeping things quiet for his
mother&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; But Bessy fretted in secret.</p>
<h2><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>XXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Johnny&rsquo;s</span> months went
uneventfully.&nbsp; At Maidment and Hurst&rsquo;s he applied
himself zealously to his trade&mdash;the more because home was a
dull place now&mdash;and he was as smart a lad as any in the shop
of his age, or perhaps of a few months older.&nbsp; He could turn
back an eyelid, too, and whip away an iron filing, or a speck of
emery grit, with such address and certainty as might astonish a
surgeon.&nbsp; The operation was one that every engineer&rsquo;s
apprentice grew apt at, and exceptional dexterity like
Johnny&rsquo;s was a matter of pride, a distinction zealously
striven for, an accomplishment to exercise at every
opportunity.&nbsp; Johnny felt that he had passed with honours on
the memorable day when Cottam, the gaffer, roared to him from the
other end of the shop to come and attend to his eye, afflicted
with a sharp grain of brass.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&mdash;not
you,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Cottam, in answer to instant offers of help
from those hard by.&nbsp; &ldquo;This &rsquo;ere&rsquo;ll stick
like a nail in a barn door.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s young May?&nbsp;
D&rsquo;y&rsquo;ear?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s young Jack
May?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of his practical knowledge Johnny owed to Long
Hicks.&nbsp; That recluse, whose sole friend hitherto <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>had been
his accordion, now declared for a second hobby, which was to turn
Johnny into the best workman at Maidment and Hurst&rsquo;s before
his time was out.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got all the
chances,&rdquo; said Long Hicks.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
servin&rsquo; yer time on small work&mdash;alwis best for
trainin&rsquo; a first-rate man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m reckoned a good
fitter, but I served time mostly on big work, or I&rsquo;d
&rsquo;a&rsquo; bin better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recommended Johnny to qualify as a marine engineer when his
apprenticeship was over, even if he intended to live a shore
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;You get yer c&rsquo;tificates, an&rsquo; then
you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; the better c&rsquo;tificates you get the better
you&rsquo;ll do, afloat or ashore.&nbsp; So as soon as your
time&rsquo;s out, off you go an&rsquo; serve your year at sea as
fourth or fifth of a good boat, if you can get the job.&nbsp; The
rest&rsquo;ll be easy as winkin&rsquo; to a quick young chap like
you.&nbsp; You can draw nice an&rsquo; neat&mdash;I can put a
thing down acc&rsquo;rate enough, but I can&rsquo;t draw it
neat&mdash;and what with one thing an&rsquo; another I
b&rsquo;lieve you could pass your second now.&nbsp; I ought to
&rsquo;a&rsquo; done it, p&rsquo;raps, but I lose me &rsquo;ed at
anythin&rsquo; like a &rsquo;xamination.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I never
&rsquo;ad over-much schoolin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Them compound
multiplications &rsquo;ud &rsquo;ave me over ev&rsquo;ry
time.&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose you don&rsquo;t think nothin&rsquo; of
a compound multiplication?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny admitted that he had gone a long way beyond that rule
of arithmetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yus,&rdquo; Hicks answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
beyond it, too, <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>teachin&rsquo; meself.&nbsp; I know &rsquo;ow to do
&rsquo;em well enough.&nbsp; But Lord! what a strain they
are!&nbsp; Tons, &rsquo;undredweights, quarters, pounds, ounces,
an&rsquo; grains, an&rsquo; multiply &rsquo;em by five
&rsquo;undred an&rsquo; twenty-seven thousan&rsquo; six
&rsquo;undred an&rsquo; eighty-three.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t no
end to a job like that, an&rsquo; yer brain on the stretch all
the time, &rsquo;cos a tick out&rsquo;ll make it about a million
tons wrong in the end.&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud send me foamin&rsquo;
mad, at a &rsquo;xamination an&rsquo; all, with a chap
waitin&rsquo; for the sum!&nbsp; Phew!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Long
Hicks&rsquo;s forehead went clammy at the fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there,&rdquo; he proceeded,
&ldquo;<i>you&rsquo;re</i> all right.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll knock
auf your second&rsquo;s examination easy as marbles; an&rsquo;
then you&rsquo;ll do yer chief&rsquo;s &rsquo;an extry
chief&rsquo;s all in one, an&rsquo; then you&rsquo;ll do the
Board o&rsquo; Trade, an&rsquo; be a guarantee chief or
anythin&rsquo; ye like!&nbsp; You will, by George!&rdquo; and the
lank man gazed in Johnny&rsquo;s face (Johnny was sitting on
Hicks&rsquo;s bed) with much respect and admiration, being fully
persuaded, in the enthusiasm of the moment, that the lad had
already as good as achieved the triumphs he prophesied.</p>
<p>But there was work to do, and Johnny did it.&nbsp; Mechanical
drawing, when its novelty had worn off, was less delightful than
the fancy-free draughtsmanship he had practised as a schoolboy,
and it had an arid twang of decimals and vulgar fractions.&nbsp;
Still, for a time there was a charm in the gradual unfolding of
the inner principles of his work, and in the disclosure, piece by
piece, <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>of the cunning complication that stood ministrant on
the main simplicity of a great steam engine; till the beauty of
the thing in its completeness came in sight, with something of
surprise in it.&nbsp; Though this, too, grew a commonplace as
familiarity cheapened it, and then his work was work
merely.&nbsp; And so it went till half the time of his
apprenticeship was over, and he was eighteen, and a sinewy young
fellow.</p>
<p>Sometimes he drew at home, and sometimes in Hicks&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; Hicks had a few books&mdash;editions a little out of
date, some of them, but all useful&mdash;and these were at
Johnny&rsquo;s service: Seaton&rsquo;s <i>Manual</i>,
Reed&rsquo;s <i>Handbook</i>, Donaldson&rsquo;s <i>Drawing and
Rough Sketching</i>, and the like.&nbsp; Hicks&rsquo;s room was
inconvenient for drawing, but nothing would tempt Hicks next
door, and once or twice Mr. Butson had come home when
Johnny&rsquo;s drawing-board and implements littered the table in
the shop-parlour, and made objections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eye!&rdquo; exclaimed Hicks, one evening, in face of
a crank-shaft elevation and sections, as Johnny held it up on the
board; &ldquo;why that&rsquo;s a drawin&rsquo; good enough to put
in a frame!&nbsp; I tell ye what, me lad.&nbsp; With a bit more
practice, an&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; the reg&rsquo;lar professional
touch, you&rsquo;ll be good enough for a draughtsman&rsquo;s
job.&nbsp; Lord! you&rsquo;ll be a master some day, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll come an&rsquo; get a job of you!&nbsp; Look
&rsquo;ere, no more o&rsquo; this gropin&rsquo; about
alone.&nbsp; Round you go to the Institute, an&rsquo; chip into
the <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>Mechanical Drawin&rsquo; class.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your
game.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll put you up to the reg&rsquo;lar
drawin&rsquo;-auffice capers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, Johnny went to the Institute.&nbsp; This was an
evening school, founded by a ship-builder twenty years
earlier.&nbsp; Here a few lads, earnest as Johnny, came to work
and to learn, and a great many more, differently disposed, came
to dabble.&nbsp; There was a gymnasium, too, and a cricket-club,
and plenty of boxing.&nbsp; And girls came, to learn cookery and
dressmaking: and there were sometimes superior visitors from
other parts, oozing with inexpensive patronage, who spoke of
Johnny and his companions as the Degraded Classes, who were to be
Raised from the Depths.</p>
<p>And so in the Institute Johnny drew, and learned the proper
drawing-office manner of projection.&nbsp; Learned also the
muscle-grinder and the long-arm balance on the horizontal bar,
and more particularly learned to pop in a straight left, to duck
and counter, and to give and take a furious pounding for three
minutes on end without losing wind or good-humour.&nbsp; So that
his attention was diverted from home, and for long he saw nothing
of the misery his mother suffered in secret, nothing of the meek
endurance of Bessy; and for the more reason because both studied
to keep him ignorant, and to show him cheerful faces.</p>
<p>But there came an evening when his eyes were opened&mdash;in
some degree, at least.&nbsp; Perhaps something <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>especially
perverse had happened in a Spring Handicap (Spring Handicaps were
just beginning), perhaps it was some other of the vexations that
beset a gentlemanly career: but certainly Mr. Henry Butson came
into Harbour Lane in no amiable mood.&nbsp; At the corner, where
a public-house shed light across the street, he ran into a stout
bare-armed girl in a faded ultramarine hat, and made to push her
roughly aside.&nbsp; But the girl stood her ground, and planted
an untender elbow near the spot where his watch-chain hung
resplendent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Garn!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;bought
the street, &rsquo;ave yer?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then as he sought to
pass on: &ldquo;D&rsquo;y&rsquo;ear!&nbsp; Ye got yer collar
an&rsquo; yer chain; where&rsquo;s yer muzzle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nowise mollified by this outrage, Mr. Butson came scowling in
at the shop door, and taking no notice of Nan, who stood at the
counter, entered the back parlour and slammed the door behind
him.&nbsp; It was barely nine o&rsquo;clock, and so early a
return was uncommon.</p>
<p>Bessy sat by the fireside, sewing.&nbsp; Mr. Butson was angry
with the world, sorely needing someone to bully, and Bessy was
providentially convenient.&nbsp; He put a cigar into his mouth
and strode across to the shelf in the corner, shoving the girl
and her chair and her crutch out of his way in a heap.&nbsp; The
shelf carried Bessy&rsquo;s tattered delight of old books; and,
dragging a random handful of leaves from among them, while a
confused <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>bunch fell on the floor, he twisted up one leaf and
thrust it into the gas flame.</p>
<p>Bessy seized his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;O don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she
pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Not out of the
book!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lot I made on the mantelpiece!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t, O don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed a glass vase stood full of pipe-lights.&nbsp; But he
jerked his elbow into her face, knocking her backward, and swore
savagely.&nbsp; He lit his pipe with the precious leaf, and then,
because Bessy wept, he took another handful from the shelf and
pitched it on the fire.&nbsp; At this, pleading the harder, she
limped forward to snatch them off, but Mr. Butson, with a timely
fling of the foot, checked her sound leg, and brought her
headlong on the fender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yus,&rdquo; he roared, furious at the contumacy,
&ldquo;you take &rsquo;em auf, when I put &rsquo;em on!&nbsp; Go
on, an&rsquo; see what I&rsquo;ll do to ye?&nbsp; Damn lazy
skewshanked &rsquo;eifer!&rdquo;&nbsp; He took her by the
shoulder as she made to rise, and pushed her forward.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go an&rsquo; earn yer livin&rsquo;, y&rsquo;idle
slut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan, in the shop, heard from the beginning, and
trembled.&nbsp; Her impulse to interfere she checked as she
might, for she well knew <i>that</i> would worsen Bessy&rsquo;s
plight; but it was choking hard.</p>
<p>In the midst Johnny burst in from the street, whistling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&nbsp;
Ill?&nbsp; You look&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>&ldquo;No&mdash;nothing, Johnny.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go
in.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; Stay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was a cry and a noise of falling.&nbsp; Johnny flung
open the parlour door and stood aghast.</p>
<p>. . . Butson pushed the girl forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
an&rsquo; earn yer livin&rsquo;, y&rsquo; idle slut!&nbsp; Get
out o&rsquo; this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second Johnny stared.&nbsp; Then he reached Butson at a
spring and knocked him backward with a swing of his right
fist.&nbsp; The crutch lay behind the man&rsquo;s heels and
tripped him, so that he sat backward on the floor, mightily
astonished.&nbsp; Johnny snatched the poker and waved it close
about Butson&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you move!&rdquo; he cried, white with
passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try to get up, or
I&rsquo;ll beat your head in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butson raised his arm to save his skull, but caught a blow
across the bone that sent it numb to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Nan, snatching
at his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Henry! pray
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away, mother,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;or
I&rsquo;ll have to hit his head!&nbsp; You blackguard
coward!&nbsp; You&mdash;you&rsquo;re a meaner hound even than I
took you for!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll touch my sister&mdash;a lame
girl&mdash;will you?&rdquo;&nbsp; At the thought he struck, but
again Nan caught at him, and only Mr. Butson&rsquo;s shoulder
suffered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Johnny!&rdquo; his mother entreated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Think o&rsquo; the neighbours!&nbsp; They can hear next
door!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>So
they could, and for the sake of trade the proprieties of Harbour
Lane must be respected.&nbsp; To have a row in the house was a
scandal unpardonable in Harbour Lane.&nbsp; In the height of his
anger Johnny remembered, and instinctively dropped his
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then call a
p&rsquo;liceman&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lock him up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s anger kept his reason half astray yet, or he
would have remembered that to have a member of the household
taken off by a policeman would be more disgraceful than twenty
rows.&nbsp; But Mr. Butson&rsquo;s consternation, though
momentary, was plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, Johnny,&rdquo; pleaded poor Nan, &ldquo;think
of the disgrace!&nbsp; Do let&rsquo;s make it up&mdash;for my
sake, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessy was crying in a corner, and Nan was choking and
sobbing.&nbsp; Johnny wavered, and the poker stopped in
mid-air.&nbsp; Butson took heart of grace and moved to get up,
though he kept his eye on the poker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better take
&rsquo;im away,&rdquo; he growled to Nan, &ldquo;if ye
don&rsquo;t want me to smash &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straightway the poker waved again, and Mr. Butson changed his
mind as to getting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Smash me?&rdquo; Johnny
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Smash me, eh?&nbsp; Keep a civil tongue, or
you shall have it now!&nbsp; See?&rdquo; and he thrust the point
against Mr. Butson&rsquo;s nose, leaving a black smear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I care for you!&nbsp; If this was
anywhere else I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; broken your head in twenty
places!&nbsp; Now you sit there an&rsquo; listen to me, Mr.
Butson.&nbsp; What you are we know.&nbsp; You came <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>here
starving, with about half a suit o&rsquo; boiler clothes in the
world, and my mother fed you&mdash;out o&rsquo; charity,
an&rsquo; worse luck.&nbsp; She fed you, and she put clothes on
your lazy carcase, and you cadged and begged as a mongrel dog
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Stop where you are, or you&rsquo;ll have
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; This with another flourish of the poker and
another smear on the nose.&nbsp; Mr. Butson sat up again, a
figure of ignominy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talked my mother over, and you married her, and
you&rsquo;ve lived on her ever since, like a gentleman&mdash;or
like what you think&rsquo;s a gentleman&mdash;you, not worth
boy&rsquo;s pay on a mud-barge!&nbsp; Now see here!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not a boy now&mdash;or at anyrate I&rsquo;m not a
little one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m within half a head as tall as
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so strong as you now perhaps, and I know
I&rsquo;m not as big.&nbsp; But some day I shall be stronger,
because you&rsquo;re rotting yourself with idleness and booze,
and then I&rsquo;ll give you a bigger hiding than you can carry,
for what I saw just now!&nbsp; You look forward to that!&nbsp;
Until then, if you put your hand within a foot of my sister
again, I&rsquo;ll brain you with this poker, or I&rsquo;ll stick
something into you,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go for you with whatever I
can lay hold of!&nbsp; Now you remember that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s voice was loud again, and once more Nan
appealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, mother,&rdquo; he answered, more quietly,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll make him understand.&nbsp; I shall keep a
little more at home in the evenings now, my fine fellow, and I
shall <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>take all this table to draw on, whether you like it or
not, unless my sister or my mother want to use it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got more right here than you.&nbsp; And if I go out
I&rsquo;ll ask about your behaviour when I come in.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve kept quiet and knuckled under to you, for the sake of
peace, and so as not to worry mother.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been
enough o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; If you want rows you shall have
&rsquo;em!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make you as frightened of me as you
are of the p&rsquo;lice.&nbsp; Ah! you know what I
mean!&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnny had no idea of what he meant himself,
but he had been sharp enough to observe the effect of his earlier
allusion to the police, and he followed it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know what I mean!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d look a deal more at home in
gaol than here, in a white shirt, eating other people&rsquo;s
victuals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butson decided that bluster would not do just at
present.&nbsp; He wondered if Johnny really did know anything,
and how much.&nbsp; But surely not, or he would go a good deal
farther.&nbsp; Anyway, best be cautious.&nbsp; So Mr. Butson
growled, &ldquo;Oh, all right.&nbsp; Damn lot o&rsquo; fuss to
make over nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want no
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bessy, still crying, took hold of her brother&rsquo;s arm
and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more, Johnny, please.&nbsp;
I&mdash;I&mdash;p&rsquo;raps I oughtn&rsquo;t to ha&rsquo; done
what I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you did!&rdquo; Johnny answered, not so cheaply
appeased.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do what you like,
Bess&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see he don&rsquo;t interfere.&nbsp; He says
he don&rsquo;t want any words&mdash;he shan&rsquo;t have
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll have something harder if he touches
<a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>you!&nbsp; Let go my arm a minute.&nbsp; Go on, you can
get up now!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; This to Butson, with the black
nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go an&rsquo; wash
yourself.&nbsp; But none o&rsquo; your tricks!&nbsp; If you try
to lay hold o&rsquo; me from behind, or anything like that,
you&rsquo;ll get it, with anything I can catch hold of!&nbsp; So
now you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mr. Henry Butson, growling indistinctly, went out to wash
his face, closely watched by Johnny, poker in hand.</p>
<p>Next door, on one side, heads were thrust out at the back-door
to listen to the unwonted noise of quarrelling at the
chandler&rsquo;s; and on the other side other heads were thrust
out at the front door.&nbsp; Because the law of irregularity in
the building of Harbour Lane decreed a back-garden to the one
house and a front-garden to the other.</p>
<h2><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>XXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">His</span> home in Harbour Lane grew less
sufferable than ever to Mr. Butson&rsquo;s tastes.&nbsp; His
contempt remained for the sordid surroundings, the vulgar trade,
the simple wife&mdash;for everything about the place in fact,
with the reasonable exceptions of the money he extracted from it
and the food he ate there; and now there was the new affliction
of an unsubmissive stepson.&nbsp; A stepson, moreover, who
watched, and who kept alert ears for any expedient assertion of
authority whereat he might raise mutiny; a most objectionable
stepson in every way, far too big, and growing bigger every day;
who would not forget bygones, and who had a nasty, suggestive way
of handling the poker&mdash;a large poker, an unnecessarily heavy
poker for a sitting-room.&nbsp; And he seemed to suspect things
too, and talked unpleasantly of the police; a thing that turned
one hot and cold together.&nbsp; So Mr. Butson went more up West,
and sought longer solace in the society of the bars.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, finding Butson ceasing, so far as he could see,
from active offence, he gave thought to other things; though
watching still.&nbsp; His drawing was among <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>the other
matters that claimed his care; but chief of them all was a
different thing altogether.</p>
<p>For at the Institute he had found the girl he first saw on the
dark morning when he set out to be an engineer.&nbsp; He had seen
her since&mdash;once as he was on his way to a ship-launch, and
twice a little later; then not at all for eighteen months at
least, till he began to forget.&nbsp; But now that he saw her
again and found her a woman&mdash;or grown as much a woman as he
was grown a man&mdash;he wondered that he could ever have
forgotten for a moment; more, when he had seen her twice or
thrice, and knew the turn of her head and the nearing of her
step, he was desperately persuaded that nothing in the world, nor
time nor tide, could make him forget again.&nbsp; So that he
resolved to learn to dance.</p>
<p>But the little society that danced at the Institute saw
nothing of her, this radiant unforgettable.&nbsp; She came twice
a week to the dressmaking class; wherein she acted as monitor or
assistant to the teacher, being, as Johnny later
discovered&mdash;by vast exertions&mdash;a dressmaker herself, in
her daily work.&nbsp; She made no friendships, walked sedately
apart, and was in some sort a mystery; being for these reasons
regarded as &ldquo;stuck-up&rdquo; by the girls of the class, and
so made a target for many small needle-thrusts of spite.&nbsp;
Johnny had a secret notion that she remembered him; because she
would pass him with so extreme an unconsciousness in her <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>manner, so
very blank an unacquaintance in her eyes.&nbsp; Neat and grey in
her dress, she had ever a placid gravity of air, almost odd by
contrast with the unceasing smirk and giggle of the rest of the
girls of the Institute.&nbsp; And her name&mdash;another happy
discovery, attained at great expense of artless
diplomacy&mdash;was Nora Sansom.</p>
<p>And now for awhile the practice of orthographic projection
suffered from neglect and abstraction of mind.&nbsp; Long Hicks,
all ignorant of the cause, was mightily concerned, and
expostulated, with a face of perplexed surprise, much poking of
fingers through the hair, and jerking at the locks thus
separated.&nbsp; But it was a great matter that tugged so
secretly at Johnny&rsquo;s mind, and daily harder at his
heart-strings, till he blushed in solitude to find himself so
weak a creature.&nbsp; Nora Sansom did not come to the
dancing.&nbsp; She knew nobody that he knew.&nbsp; She was
unapproachable as&mdash;as a Chinese Empress.&nbsp; How to
approach Nora Sansom?&nbsp; And at the thought he gulped and
tingled, and was more than a little terrified.&nbsp; He was not
brought to a stand by contemplation of any distinct interposing
labyrinth of conventional observance, such as he who can see can
pick his way through in strict form; but by a difficulty palpable
to instinct rather than figured in mind: an intangible barrier
that vexed Johnny to madness, so that he hammered the Institute
punching-ball <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>with blind fury.&nbsp; And again, because the world was
now grown so many heavens wider, he would sit and dream of things
beyond its farthest margin yet.&nbsp; And between plan and
section, crank-shaft and piston, he would wake to find himself
designing monograms of the letters N. S. and J. M.&nbsp;
Altogether becoming a sad young fool, such as none of us ever was
in the like circumstances.</p>
<p>But an angel&mdash;two angels, to be exact, both of them
rather stout&mdash;came one night to Johnny&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp;
They came all unwitting, in a cab, being man and wife, and their
simple design was to see for themselves the Upraising of the
Hopeless Residuum.&nbsp; They had been told, though they scarce
believed, that at the Institute, far East&mdash;much farther East
than Whitechapel, and therefore, without doubt, deeper sunk in
dirt and iniquity&mdash;the young men and women danced together
under regular ball-room conventions, neither bawling choruses nor
pounding one another with quart pots.&nbsp; It was even said that
partners were introduced in proper form before dancing&mdash;a
thing so ludicrous in its incongruity as to give no choice but
laughter.&nbsp; So the two doubters from the West End (it was
only Bayswater, really) took a cab, to see these things for
themselves.</p>
<p>But, having taken no pains to inform themselves of the order
of things at the Institute, they arrived on an evening when there
was no dancing.&nbsp; This was very <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>annoying, and they said so, with
acerbity.&nbsp; They were, indeed, so very indignant at the
disconformity of the arrangements to their caprice, and so
extremely and so obviously important, and the lady waggled her
gilt-handled lorgnon with such offended majesty, that it was
discussed among those in direction whether or not something might
be done to appease them.&nbsp; And in the end, after a few hasty
inquiries, the classes were broken up for the evening and an
off-hand dance was declared, to the music extracted from the
Institute piano and the fiddle of a blushing young amateur.</p>
<p>The girls came in gay and chattering from the dressmaking
class, and the lads rushed to exchange gymnasium-flannels for the
clothes they had come in&mdash;all unconscious that they were to
be made a show of.&nbsp; They who kept their dancing-shoes on the
premises triumphed in their foresight, and Johnny was among
them.&nbsp; As for him, he had seen Nora Sansom coming in with
the others, alone and a little shy, and he resolved to seize
occasion with both hands.</p>
<p>And he did so very gallantly, with less trepidation than at a
calmer moment he would have judged possible.&nbsp; First a
quadrille was called, and Johnny&rsquo;s courage rose&mdash;for
as yet he had no great confidence in his dancing in general, but
he <i>did</i> know the figures of a quadrille, having learned
them by rote, as most boys learn Euclid.&nbsp; He laid hands on
the mild young <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>shopman who had unexpectedly found himself appointed
master of ceremonies, and in two minutes he was standing in a set
with Nora Sansom at his side.&nbsp; The sheer pride of it
disorganised his memory, so that it was lucky they were a side
couple, or there would have been a rout in the first
figure.&nbsp; Johnny&rsquo;s partner knew very little or nothing
of dancing, but she was quick to learn, and Johnny, a rank
beginner himself, had a proud advantage in his knowledge of the
figures&mdash;unstable as it was.&nbsp; So that the thing went
very joyfully, and the girl&rsquo;s eyes grew brighter and her
face gayer each moment to the end.&nbsp; For her life had been
starved of merriment, and here was merriment in plenty, of the
sort a girl loves.</p>
<p>Four or five dances were all there were, for the place shut at
ten.&nbsp; To dance them all with Nora Sansom were impossible and
scandalous, for everybody was very &ldquo;particular&rdquo; at
the Institute.&nbsp; But Johnny went as far as two and a
&ldquo;sit out,&rdquo; and extracted a half-promise that she
would come and dance some other time.&nbsp; More, he walked two
streets of the way home with her, and the way was paved with
clouds of glory.&nbsp; Why he might go no farther he could not
guess, but there he was dismissed, quite unmistakably, though
pleasantly enough.</p>
<p>Fair, very fair were the poor little streets in the moonlight
as Johnny walked home, and very sweet the <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>air.&nbsp;
It was a good world, a kind world, a world as one may see it who
has emptied a bottle of good champagne.&nbsp; Johnny would have
shaken hands with anybody on the way&mdash;probably even with
Butson if he had met him; but nobody made the offer, and even the
baked-chestnut man&mdash;he was still there, by the high
wall&mdash;growled merely when Johnny gave him good night.&nbsp;
And so Johnny went to dreams of gentle grey eyes in a dimpled
face with brown hair about it.&nbsp; For few of the song-book
beauties were Nora Sansom&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her hair was neither
golden nor black, but simple brown like the hair of most other
people, and her eyes were mere grey; yet Johnny dreamed.</p>
<p>As for the two angels from Bayswater who caused all these
things to come to pass, they looked at the dancing from the
gallery, and said that it was really very creditable,
considering; quite surprising, indeed, for people of that class,
and they hoped it didn&rsquo;t lead to immorality.&nbsp; And they
went home virtuously conscious of having done their duty toward
the Submerged.&nbsp; But the lady left her gilt-handled lorgnon
in the cab, whereof the gentleman hadn&rsquo;t thought to take
the number.&nbsp; And the lady said a great many times before
they went to bed (and after) that it was Just Like a Man.</p>
<h2><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>XXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weeks went, and the time neared
when dancing at the Institute would end for the
season&mdash;would end with a bang and a dazzle in a &ldquo;long
night,&rdquo; when dancing would be kept up shamelessly till
something nearer one o&rsquo;clock than twelve.&nbsp; Johnny
counted, first the weeks, then the days, and last the
hours.&nbsp; Not because of the dancing, although that was
amusing, but because he was to take Nora Sansom with his double
ticket.&nbsp; For herself, she may have counted days and hours,
or may not; but true it was that she sat up late on several
nights, with nun&rsquo;s veiling and ribbons, making a dress for
the occasion&mdash;the first fine frock that had been hers.&nbsp;
And every night she hid it carefully.</p>
<p>Each dressmaking-class night of late it had been
Johnny&rsquo;s privilege to guard her home-going to the end of
that second street&mdash;never farther.&nbsp; Twice she had come
to dancing, and by that small practice was already Johnny&rsquo;s
superior at the exercise; for a big-shouldered novice of eleven
stone two is a slower pupil than any girl of eighteen in the
world.&nbsp; And they were very welcome one to the other, and
acquaintance bettered day <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>by day.&nbsp; Once Johnny ventured a
question about the adventure of the morning, now more than three
years ago, but learned little from Miss Sansom&rsquo;s
answer.&nbsp; The lady who was ill was her relation, she said,
and she found her; and then she talked of something else.</p>
<p>And so till the evening before the &ldquo;long
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the rule at the Institute to honour
the long night with gloves and white ties, by way of compromise
with evening dress; and Johnny bought his gloves with discretion
and selected his tie with care.&nbsp; Then he went to the
Institute, took a turn or two at the bars, climbed up the rope,
and gave another member a lesson with the gloves.&nbsp; Thus
refreshed, he dressed himself in his walking clothes, making sure
that the tie and the gloves were safe in his pocket, and set out
for home.&nbsp; There was no dressmaking class that night, so
that he need not wait.&nbsp; But outside and plainly waiting for
him, was Nora Sansom herself.&nbsp; Johnny thought she had been
crying: as in fact she had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. May,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
very sorry, but&mdash;I thought you might be here,
and&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I shan&rsquo;t be able to
come to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not come!&nbsp; But&mdash;but why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;m very sorry, Mr. May;
but I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a quiver of the lip, and her voice was a little
uneven, as though there were danger of more tears.&nbsp; <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>But Johnny
was not disappointed merely; he was also angry, and it was hard
to conceal the fact.&nbsp; So he said nothing, but turned and
walked a few steps by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;hope you won&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she pursued,
uneasy at his silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much
disappointed&mdash;very much indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was
plain that she was.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there&rsquo;ll be a good
many there.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll have plenty of
partners.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last she found a hard thing to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how many&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo;
Johnny replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said curtly, almost angrily, but Nora Sansom heard it
with an odd little tremor of pleasure.&nbsp; Though she merely
said, &ldquo;But why not?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no reason why you
should be disappointed too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; he said; and after
a pause added: &ldquo;Perhaps you might ha&rsquo; gone if I
hadn&rsquo;t asked you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she answered, with tears
in eyes and voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know I shouldn&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
I never go anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny instantly felt himself a brute.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t mean anything unkind.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going without
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He might have said something more, but a little
group of people <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>came straggling past.&nbsp; And the girl, with her eyes
on this group, said the first thing that came to her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh anywhere.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Walk
about, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked shyly up in his face, and down again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>I</i> might go for a walk,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s heart gave a great beat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she would be questioned into nothing definite.&nbsp;
<i>If</i> she took a walk, she <i>might</i> go in such and such a
direction, passing this or that place at seven o&rsquo;clock, or
half-past.&nbsp; That was all.&nbsp; And now she must hurry away,
for she had already been too long.</p>
<p>What mattered the dance to Johnny now?&nbsp; A fig for the
dance.&nbsp; Let them dance that liked, and let them dance the
floor through if it pleased them.&nbsp; But how was it that Nora
Sansom could take a walk to-morrow evening, yet could not come to
the Institute?&nbsp; That was difficult to understand.&nbsp;
Still, hang the dance!</p>
<p>For Nora it would be harder to speak.&nbsp; Howbeit indeed the
destruction of the looked-for evening&rsquo;s gladness, in her
first fine frock, had been a bitter thing.&nbsp; <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>But that
day her hiding-place had been discovered, and now the dress that
had cost such thoughtful design and such hopeful labour was
lying, rolled and ticketed, on a pawnbroker&rsquo;s shelf.</p>
<h2><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>XXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> they must come to Blackwall
Pier was assured.&nbsp; For there were no streets, no crowds, no
rumbling waggons; there were the wide sky and the unresting
river, the breeze, the ships, and the endless train of
brown-sailed barges.&nbsp; No unseamanlike garden-seats
dishonoured the quay then, and strolling lovers sat on bollards
or chains, or sat not at all.</p>
<p>Here came Johnny and Nora Sansom when the shrinking arc of
daylight was far and yellow in the west, and the Kentish hills
away to the left grew dusk and mysterious.&nbsp; The tide ran
high, and tugs were busy.&nbsp; A nest of them, with steam up,
lay under the wharf wall to the right of the pier-barge, waiting
for work; some were already lighted, and, on the rest, men were
trimming the lamps or running them up, while a cheerful glow came
from each tiny cabin and engine-room.&nbsp; Rascal boys flitted
about the quays and gangways&mdash;the boys that are always near
boats and water, ever failing to get drowned, and ever dodging
the pestered men who try to prevent it.</p>
<p>The first star of the evening steadied and brightened, <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>and soon
was lost amid other stars.&nbsp; Below, the river set its
constellations as silently, one after another, trembling and
blinking; and meteor tugs shot across its firmament, in white and
green and red.&nbsp; Along shore the old Artichoke Tavern, gables
and piles, darkened and melted away, and then lit into a little
Orion, a bright cluster in the bespangled riverside.&nbsp; Ever
some new sail came like a ghost up reach out of the gloom,
rounded the point, and faded away; and by times some distant
voice was heard in measured cry over water.</p>
<p>They said little; for what need to talk?&nbsp; They loitered
awhile near the locks, and saw the turning Trinity light with its
long, solemn wink, heard a great steamer hoot, far down Woolwich
reach.&nbsp; Now the yellow in the sky was far and dull indeed,
and a myriad of stars trembled over the brimming river.&nbsp; A
tug puffed and sobbed, and swung out from the group under the
wharf, beating a glistering tail of spray, and steaming off at
the head of a train of lighters.&nbsp; Out from the dark of
Woolwich Reach came a sailing-ship under bare spars, drawn by
another tug.&nbsp; In the middle of the river the ship dropped
anchor, and the tug fell back to wait, keeping its place under
gentle steam.</p>
<p>They walked on the wharf, by the iron cranes, and far to the
end, under the windows of the abandoned Brunswick Hotel.&nbsp;
Here they were quite alone, and <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>here they sat together on a broad
and flat-topped old bollard.</p>
<p>Presently said Johnny, &ldquo;Are you sorry for the dance
now&mdash;Nora?&rdquo;&nbsp; And lost his breath at the name.</p>
<p>Nora&mdash;he called her Nora; was she afraid or was she
glad?&nbsp; What was this before her?&nbsp; But with her eyes she
saw only the twinkling river, with the lights and the stars.</p>
<p>Presently she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was very sorry,&rdquo;
she said slowly . . . &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;Nora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still she saw but the river and the lights; but she was glad;
timid, too, but very glad.&nbsp; Johnny&rsquo;s hand stole to her
side, took hers, and kept it. . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;not sorry&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was before her mattered nothing; he sat by her&mdash;held
her hand. . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Not sorry
now&mdash;Johnny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why came tears so readily to her eyes?&nbsp; Truly they had
long worn their path.&nbsp; But this&mdash;this was joy. . .
.&nbsp; He bent his head, and kissed her.&nbsp; The wise old
Trinity light winked very slowly, and winked again.</p>
<p>So they sat and talked; sometimes whispered.&nbsp; Vows,
promises, nonsense all&mdash;what mattered the words to so
wonderful a tune?&nbsp; And the eternal stars, a million ages
away, were nearer, all nearer, than the world of common life
about them.&nbsp; What was for her she knew <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>now and
saw&mdash;she also: a new heaven and a new earth.</p>
<p>Over the water from the ship came, swinging and slow, a stave
of the chanty:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a flying-fish sailor straight
home from Hong-Kong&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp;
Aye!&nbsp; Blow the man down!<br />
Blow the man down, bully, blow the man down&mdash;<br />
O give us some time to blow the man down!</p>
<p>Ye&rsquo;re a dirty Black-Baller just in from New
York&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp;
Aye!&nbsp; Blow the man down!<br />
Blow the man down, bully, blow the man down&mdash;<br />
O give us some time to blow the man down!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time went, but time was not for them.&nbsp; Where the
tug-engineer, thrusting up his head for a little fresh air, saw
but a prentice-lad and his sweetheart on a bollard, there sat Man
and Woman, enthroned and exultant in face of the worlds.</p>
<p>The ship swung round on the tide, bringing her lights square
and her stem for the opening lock.&nbsp; The chanty went wailing
to its end:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blow the man down, bully, blow the man
down&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To my Aye!
Aye!&nbsp; Blow the man down!<br />
Singapore Harbour to gay London town&mdash;<br />
O give us some time to blow the man down!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tug headed for the dock and the ship went in her wake with
slow state, a gallant shadow amid the blue.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>Soon
the tide stood, and stood, and then began its ebb.&nbsp; For a
space there was a deeper stillness as the dim wharves hung in
mid-mist, and water and sky were one.&nbsp; Then the air stirred
and chilled, stars grew sharper, and the Thames turned its
traffic seaward.</p>
<h2><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>XXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Happiness</span> never stayed long with
Nora Sansom.&nbsp; Little, indeed, had been her portion, and it
was a poor sort at best.&nbsp; But this new joy was so great that
it must needs be short of life; and in truth she saw good
reason.&nbsp; From the moment of parting with Johnny doubts had
troubled her; and doubts grew to distress&mdash;even to
misery.&nbsp; She saw no end&mdash;no end but sorrow.&nbsp; She
had been carried away; she had forgotten.&nbsp; And in measure as
her sober senses awoke she saw that all this gladness could but
end in heart-break and bereavement.&nbsp; Better, then, end all
quickly and have done with the pang.&nbsp; But herein she
misjudged her strength.</p>
<p>Doubts and perplexities assailed Johnny also, though for a
time they grew to nothing sharper.&nbsp; He would have gone home
straightway, proud and joyful, if a little sheepish, to tell his
mother the tale of that evening.&nbsp; But Nora had implored him
to say nothing yet.&nbsp; She wanted time to think things over,
she said.&nbsp; And she left him at the familiar corner, two
streets beyond the Institute, begging him to come no farther, for
this time, at anyrate.&nbsp; Next evening was the evening of the
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>dressmaking class.&nbsp; He saw her for a few minutes,
on her way through those two familiar streets, and he thought she
looked unwell.</p>
<p>A few nights later he saw her again.&nbsp; Plainly she had
been crying.&nbsp; When they came to a deserted street of shut-up
wharves he asked her why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only&mdash;only I&rsquo;ve been thinking!&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About you, Johnny&mdash;about you and me.&nbsp;
We&mdash;I think&mdash;we&rsquo;re very young, aren&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That had not struck him as a difficulty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about
that.&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose we are, like others.&nbsp; But I shall
be out o&rsquo; my time in two years and a half, or not much
more, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, then,&rdquo; she said, catching at the word,
&ldquo;p&rsquo;raps then it will be different&mdash;and&mdash;I
mean we shall be older and know better, Johnny.&nbsp;
And&mdash;now&mdash;we can often see one another and talk like
friends&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked up to read his
eyes, trembling.</p>
<p>Something cold took Johnny by the throat, and checked his
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;what&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
mean&mdash;that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, though it was bitter hard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be best&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure,
Johnny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny gulped, and his voice hardened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;if you want to throw me over you might say so, in
straight English!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk like that,
Johnny!&rdquo; she pleaded, and laid her hand on his arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unkind!&nbsp; You know it&rsquo;s
unkind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s only plain an&rsquo; honest.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t understand this half-and-half business&mdash;seeing
each other &lsquo;like friends&rsquo; an&rsquo; all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more effort she made to hold her position&mdash;but her
strength was near gone.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be better,
Johnny&mdash;truly it will!&nbsp; You&mdash;you might meet
someone you&rsquo;d like better, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my look-out; time to talk about that when
it comes.&nbsp; The other night you let me kiss you, and you
kissed me back&mdash;told me you loved me.&nbsp; Now you
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Maybe you&rsquo;ve met someone you like
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out no more.&nbsp; Her head fell on his shoulder, and
she broke into an agony of tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Johnny, Johnny,
that is cruel!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know how cruel it is!&nbsp;
I shall never like anybody better than you&mdash;never half so
much.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be unkind!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not one
friend in the world but you, and I do love you more than
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Johnny was ready to kick himself for a
ruffian.&nbsp; He looked about, but nobody else was in the
shadowy street.&nbsp; He kissed Nora, he called himself hard
names, and he quieted her, though she still sobbed.&nbsp; And
there was no more talk of mere friendship.&nbsp; She had tried
her compromise, and had broken down.&nbsp; But <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>presently
Johnny ventured to ask if she foresaw any difficulty with her
parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; she said simply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been dead for years.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the
first word of her family matters that Johnny had heard.&nbsp;
Should he come to see her mother?&nbsp; The question struck her
like a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, Johnny,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
yet&mdash;no, you mustn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you
why&mdash;I can&rsquo;t really; at anyrate not now.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then after a pause, &ldquo;O Johnny, I&rsquo;m in such
trouble!&nbsp; Such trouble, Johnny!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she wept
again.</p>
<p>But tell her trouble she would not.&nbsp; At anyrate not
then.&nbsp; And in the end she left Johnny much mystified, and
near as miserable as herself, because of his blind helplessness
in this unrevealed affliction.</p>
<p>Inexpert in mysteries, he was all incomprehension.&nbsp; What
was this trouble that he must not be told of?&nbsp; He did not
even know where Nora lived.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t she tell
him?&nbsp; Why did she never let him see her as far as
home?&nbsp; This much he knew: that she had a mother, but had
lost her father by death.&nbsp; And this he had but just learned
from her under stress of tears.&nbsp; He was not to see her
mother&mdash;at least not yet.&nbsp; And Nora was in sore
trouble, but refused to say what the trouble was.&nbsp; That
night he moped and brooded.&nbsp; And at Maidment and
Hurst&rsquo;s next morning&mdash;it was Saturday&mdash;Mr. Cottam
the gaffer swore, and made remarks about <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>the
expedience of being thoroughly awake before dinner-time.&nbsp;
More, at one o&rsquo;clock Johnny passed the pay-box without
taking his money, and turned back for it, when reminded, amid the
chaff of his shopmates, many offers of portership, and some
suggestions to scramble the slighted cash.</p>
<p>Not far from the yard-gate he saw a small crowd of people
about a public-house; and as he neared he perceived Mother
Born-drunk in the midst of it.&nbsp; The publican had refused to
serve her&mdash;indeed, had turned her out&mdash;and now she
swayed about his door and proclaimed him at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Shultin&rsquo; a lady!&rdquo; she screamed
hoarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go in plashe &rsquo;thout
bein&rsquo; &rsquo;shulted.&nbsp; &rsquo;Shulted by low common
public-&rsquo;oush.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you stand it, ducky!&rdquo; sang out a
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You give &rsquo;em what for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she seemed inclined to turn her wrath on her
natural enemy, the boy, but her eye fell on a black bottle with a
broken neck, lying in the gutter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gi&rsquo;
&rsquo;em what for?&rdquo; she hiccupped, stooping for the
bottle, &ldquo;Yesh, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> gi&rsquo; &rsquo;em what
for!&rdquo; and with that flung the bottle at the largest window
in sight.</p>
<p>There was a crash, a black hole in the midst of the plate
glass, and a vast &ldquo;spider&rdquo; of cracks to its farthest
corners.&nbsp; Mother Born-drunk stood and stared, perhaps a
little sobered.&nbsp; Then a barman ran out, tucking in his <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>apron, and
took her by the arm.&nbsp; There were yells and screams and
struggles, and cheers from blackguard boys; and Mother Born-drunk
was hauled off, screaming and sliding and stumbling, between a
policeman and the publican.</p>
<p>Johnny told his mother, when he reached home, that her old
acquaintance Emma Pacey was like to endure a spell of gaol.&nbsp;
But what occupied his mind was Nora&rsquo;s trouble, and he
forgot Mother Born-drunk for three or four days.</p>
<p>Then came the next evening of the dressmaking class at the
Institute, and he went, never doubting to meet Nora as she came
away.&nbsp; At the door the housekeeper, who was also
hall-porter, beckoned, and gave him a letter, left earlier in the
day.&nbsp; It was addressed to him by name, in a weak and
straggling female hand, and for a moment he stared at it, not a
little surprised.&nbsp; When he tore open the envelope he found a
blotchy, tear-stained rag of a letter, and read this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dearest
Johnny</span>,&mdash;It is all over now and I do hope you will
forgive me for not telling you before.&nbsp; This is to say
good-bye and God bless you and pray forget all about me.&nbsp; It
was wrong of me to let it go so far but I did love you so Johnny,
and I could not help it and then I didn&rsquo;t know what to
do.&nbsp; I can never come to the classes again with all this
disgrace and everything printed in the newspapers and I must get
work somewhere where they don&rsquo;t know me.&nbsp; I would
rather die, but I must look after her as well as I can, Johnny,
because she is my mother.&nbsp; Burn this at once and forget all
about me and some day you will meet <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>some nice girl belonging to a
respectable family and nothing to be ashamed of.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t try to find me&mdash;that will only make us both
miserable.&nbsp; Good-bye and please forgive me.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours affectionately,<br />
<span class="smcap">Nora Sansom</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was this?&nbsp; What did it all mean?&nbsp; He stood in
the gymnasium dressing-room to read it, and when he looked up,
the gaslight danced and the lockers spun about him.&nbsp; The one
clear thing was that Nora said good-bye, and was gone.</p>
<p>Presently his faculties assorted themselves, and he read the
letter again; and then once more.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;all
over&rdquo; and she asked him to forgive her for not telling him
before.&nbsp; Telling him what?&nbsp; She told him nothing
now.&nbsp; She would never come to the Institute again, and he
didn&rsquo;t know her address, and he mustn&rsquo;t try to find
her.&nbsp; But then there was &ldquo;everything printed in the
newspapers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, he must look at the
newspapers; why so long realising that?&nbsp; He went to the
reading-room and applied himself to the pile of papers and
magazines that littered the table.&nbsp; One paper after another
he searched and searched again, but saw nothing that he could
connect with Nora, by any stretch of imagination.&nbsp; Till he
found a stray sheet of the day before, with rings of coffee-stain
on it.&nbsp; The &ldquo;police intelligence&rdquo; lay uppermost,
and in the midst of the column the name <i>Emma Sansom</i>, in
italic letters, caught his <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>eye.&nbsp; She was forty-one, and
was charged with drunkenness and wilful damage.&nbsp; A sentence
more, and everything stood displayed, as by a flash of lightning;
for he had witnessed the offence himself, on Saturday.&nbsp; Emma
Sansom was the married name of Emma Pacey, whom the boys called
Mother Born-drunk; and the woman was Nora&rsquo;s mother!</p>
<p>Now it was plain&mdash;all, from the very beginning, when the
child wandered in the night seeking her strayed and drunken
mother, and inquired for her with the shamed excuse that she was
ill.&nbsp; This was why he was not to call to see Nora&rsquo;s
mother; and it was for this that Nora hindered him from seeing
her home.</p>
<p>There was the shameful report, all at length.&nbsp; The
publican&rsquo;s tale was simple and plain enough.&nbsp; He had
declined to serve the prisoner because she was drunk, and as she
refused to leave, he had her turned out, though, he said, she
made no particular resistance.&nbsp; Shortly afterward he heard a
crash, and found a broken bottle and a great deal of broken glass
in the bar.&nbsp; He had gone outside, and saw the prisoner being
held by his barman.&nbsp; His plate-glass window was smashed, and
it was worth ten pounds.&nbsp; There was little more
evidence.&nbsp; The police told his worship that the prisoner had
been fined small sums for drunkenness before, but she was usually
inoffensive, except for collecting crowds of boys.&nbsp; This was
the first charge against her involving damage.&nbsp; <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>She was the
widow of a ship&rsquo;s officer lost at sea, and she had a small
annuity, but was chiefly supported of late by her
daughter&mdash;a dressmaker&mdash;a very respectable young
woman.&nbsp; The daughter was present (the reporter called her
&ldquo;a prepossessing young female in great distress&rdquo;),
and she wished to be allowed to pay the damage in small
instalments.&nbsp; But in the end her mother was sent to prison
for a month in default of payment of fine and damage.&nbsp; For
indeed the daughter was a minor, and her undertaking was
worthless.</p>
<p>One thing Johnny looked for eagerly, but did not
find&mdash;the prisoner&rsquo;s address.&nbsp; Whether
consideration for the daughter had prompted the reporter to that
suppression, or whether it was due to accident, Johnny could not
guess.&nbsp; In other reports in the same column some addresses
were given and some not.&nbsp; But straightway Johnny went to beg
the housekeeper that he might rummage the store of old papers for
those of the day before.&nbsp; For to desert Nora now, in her
trouble, was a thing wholly inconceivable; and so far from
burning the letter, he put it, envelope and all, in his safest
pocket, and felt there, more than once, to be assured of its
safety.</p>
<p>But the address was in none of the papers.&nbsp; In fact the
report was in no more than three, and in one of those it was but
five lines long.&nbsp; What should he do?&nbsp; He could not even
write her one line of comfort.&nbsp; And <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>he had been
going on with his work placidly all Monday while Nora had been
standing up in a police-court, weeping and imploring mercy for
her wretched mother!&nbsp; If he had known he could scarce have
done anything to aid her.&nbsp; But helplessness was no
consolation&mdash;rather the cruellest of aggravations.</p>
<p>Well, there stood the matter, and raving would not help it,
nor would beating the table&mdash;nor even the head&mdash;with
the fist.&nbsp; He must somehow devise a way to reach Nora.</p>
<h2><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>XXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> resolved, first, to try the
Institute.&nbsp; Nora&rsquo;s name and address must be on the
class registers; but what business had he with the girl&rsquo;s
class registers?&nbsp; As diplomatist his failure was
lamentable.&nbsp; He could invent no reasonable excuses, and
ignoble defeat was his fate at the hands of the rigid lady who
managed the girls department of the Institute.&nbsp; Then he took
to prowling about all the streets that lay beyond that second
corner that had marked the end of their evening walks, watching
for her; searching also, desperately, for some impossible sign
about a house that might suggest that she lived in it.&nbsp; Thus
he spent the daylight of two evenings watching a little
muslin-hung window, because the muslin was tied with a ribbon of
a sort he remembered her to have worn, and because he chose to
fancy a neatness and a daintiness about the tying that might well
be hers.&nbsp; But on the second evening as dusk fell the window
opened, and a hairy, red-bearded man in blue shirt sleeves put
out his head and leaned on the sill to smoke his pipe and watch
the red sky.&nbsp; Johnny swung away savagely, and called himself
a fool for his pains; <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>and indeed, he could ill afford to
waste time, for Maidment and Hurst claimed him till five each
day, and a few hours in the evening were all that remained; more,
Nora would change her lodgings&mdash;perhaps had done so
already.</p>
<p>After this he screwed his courage so high as to go to the
police-station where the charge against Nora&rsquo;s mother must
have been taken, and to ask for her address.&nbsp; But the
cast-iron-faced inspector in charge took <i>his</i> name and
address instead, as a beginning, and then would tell him
nothing.&nbsp; And at last, maddened and reckless, he went to the
publican, and demanded the information of him.&nbsp; Now if
Johnny had had a little more worldly experience, a little more
cunning, and a great deal more coolness, he would have done this
at first, and, beginning by ordering a drink, he would have
opened a casual conversation, led it to the matter of the window,
and in the end would have gained his point quietly and
easily.&nbsp; But as it was, he did none of these things.&nbsp;
He ordered no drink, and he made a blunt request, taking little
thought of its manner, none of the publican&rsquo;s point of
view, and perhaps forgetting that the man was in no way
responsible for the rebuffs already endured.&nbsp; The publican,
for his part, was already in a bad temper, because of the clumsy
tapping of a barrel and ensuing &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; of the
potman.&nbsp; So he answered Johnny&rsquo;s demand by asking if
he had come to pay for the window; <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>and receiving the negative reply he
had expected, he urgently recommended the intruder&rsquo;s
departure &ldquo;outside&rdquo;: in such terms as gave no choice
but compliance.</p>
<p>So that now, in extremity, Johnny resolved on a last
expedient: one that had been vaguely in his mind for a day or
two, though he had yet scarce had courage to consider it
seriously.&nbsp; This was, to tell his mother the whole thing;
and to induce her, if he might, to ask the address at the
Institute&mdash;perhaps on some pretext of dressmaking
business.&nbsp; He was not hopeful, for he well knew that any
hint of traffic with the family of one such as Nora&rsquo;s
mother would be a horror to her.&nbsp; But he could see nothing
else, and to sit still were intolerable.&nbsp; Moreover he
guessed that his mother must suspect something from his
preoccupation, and his neglect of his drawing.&nbsp; Though
indeed poor Nan was most at pains, just then, to conceal troubles
of her own.</p>
<p>Mr. Butson, in fact, began to chafe under the restraints of
narrow circumstances.&nbsp; Not that he was poorer than had been
his habit&mdash;indeed he was much better off&mdash;but that his
needs had expanded with his prosperity and with his successes in
society.&nbsp; And it was just now that his wife began to attempt
retrenchment.&nbsp; Probably she was encouraged by the outrageous
revolt of her son, a revolt which had made advisable a certain
degree of caution on the part of himself, the head of the
household.&nbsp; She spoke of a rumour that the ship-yard <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>opposite
might close, as so many other Thames ship-yards had closed of
late years.&nbsp; That, she said, would mean ruin for the shop,
and she must try to save what little she might, meantime.&nbsp;
An absurdity, of course, in Mr. Butson&rsquo;s view.&nbsp; He
felt no interest in the rumours of old women about ship-yards,
and petty measurement of the sordid chances of trade irritated
him.&nbsp; If his wife found one source of profit running dry,
she must look out and tap another, that was all.&nbsp; So long as
he got what he wanted he troubled little about the manner of its
getting.&nbsp; But now he ran near having less than he wanted,
and his wife was growing even less accommodating.&nbsp; She went
so far as to hint of withholding the paltry sum the lad earned;
he should have it himself, she thought, to buy his clothes, and
to save toward the end of his apprenticeship.&nbsp; More than
this, Mr. Butson much suspected that Johnny had actually had his
own money for some while past, and that Mrs. Butson had descended
to the mean subterfuge of representing as his earnings a sum
which in reality she extracted each week from the till; an act of
pure embezzlement.&nbsp; And then there was the cottage in Epping
Forest.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t sell it now, though she wanted
to sell when she first left it.&nbsp; What good was there in
keeping it?&nbsp; True there was three-and-sixpence a week of
rent, but that was nothing; it would go in a round of drinks, or
in half a round, in any distinguished bar; and there were
deductions even <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>from the three-and-sixpence.&nbsp; Sold, the cottage
might produce a respectable sum&mdash;perhaps a hundred
pounds&mdash;at anyrate eighty.&nbsp; The figures stirred his
blood.&nbsp; What a magnificent dash a man might cut with eighty
pounds!&nbsp; And a fortune might be made out of it, too, if it
were used wisely, and not buried away in a wretched
three-and-sixpenny cottage.&nbsp; Properly invested on judicious
flat-race Certainties, it would double itself about twice a
week.&nbsp; So he made it very plain to Nan that the sale of the
cottage for what it would fetch and the handing over of the
proceeds was a plan he insisted on.&nbsp; But the stupid woman
wouldn&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp; It was plain that she was beginning
to over-estimate her importance in the establishment, by reason
that of late she had not been sufficiently sworn at, shoved,
thumped, and twisted and pinched on the arms.&nbsp; That was the
worst of kindness to a woman&mdash;she took advantage.</p>
<p>So that he was obliged to begin to thump again.&nbsp; There
was no need to do it so that Johnny might know, and so cause a
low disturbance.&nbsp; In fact, Johnny took little notice of
things at home just now, no longer made inquiries, nor lifted the
poker with so impudent a stare; and he was scarce indoors at
all.&nbsp; Wherefore Mr. Butson punched and ruffianed&mdash;being
careful to leave no disreputable marks in visible spots, such as
black eyes&mdash;and sometimes he kicked; and he demanded more
money and more, but all the while insisted on the sale of the <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>cottage.&nbsp; The monstrous laws of conveyance made it
impossible for him to lay hands on the deeds and sell the place
himself, or he would have done it, of course.&nbsp; And he made
it advisable, too, for Bessy to avoid him&mdash;and that had a
better effect than any direct attack on Nan.&nbsp; Till at last
the woman was so far reduced that she was near a very dangerous
rebellion indeed&mdash;nearer than Mr. Butson suspected.&nbsp;
For she began to think of attempting a separation by
magistrate&rsquo;s order, shameful as it would be in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Though she feared greatly.</p>
<p>So it was when Johnny turned toward home on an evening a
little before nine o&rsquo;clock, sick of blind searching, and
ready to tell his mother the story of Nora Sansom, first to
last.&nbsp; At Harbour Lane corner he saw Butson walking off, and
wondered to see him about Blackwall so early in the evening.</p>
<p>Nobody was in the shop, and Johnny went through so quietly
that he surprised his mother and Bessy, in the shop-parlour,
crying bitterly.&nbsp; Nan sat on a chair and Bessy bent over
her, and no concealment was possible.&nbsp; Johnny was seized by
a dire surmise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
this?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he been
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan bent lower, but answered nothing.&nbsp; Johnny looked
toward Bessy, almost sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s
beaten mother again,&rdquo; Bessy blurted, between sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beaten mother!&nbsp; Again!&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnny&rsquo;s
face was white, <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>and his nostrils stood wide and round.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Beaten mother!&nbsp; Again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always doing it now,&rdquo; Bessy
sobbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And wanting more money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d a
good mind to tell you before, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beaten mother!&rdquo;&nbsp; The room swam before
Johnny&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan rose to close the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Johnny,&rdquo;
she said meekly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit upset, but
don&rsquo;t let it upset you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your leg?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re limping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kicked her!&nbsp; I saw him kick at her
ankle!&rdquo; Bessy burst out, pouring forth the tale
unrestrained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tried to stop him
and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he hit you?&rdquo; asked Johnny, not so white
in the cheeks now, but whiter than ever about the mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but it was mother most!&rdquo; and Bessy wept
afresh.</p>
<p>Perhaps his evenings of disappointment had chastened
Johnny&rsquo;s impatience.&nbsp; He knew that the man was out of
reach now, and he forced his fury down.&nbsp; In ten minutes he
knew the whole thing, between Bessy&rsquo;s outpourings and
Nan&rsquo;s tearful admissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is he coming back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not know&mdash;probably he would be late, <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>as
usual.&nbsp; &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t go doing anything hasty,
Johnny,&rdquo; Nan implored; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so afraid of you
doing something rash!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not much,
really&mdash;I&rsquo;m a bit upset, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to think about this,&rdquo; Johnny
said, with such calmness that Nan felt somewhat reassured, though
Bessy was inwardly afraid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out for
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode away to the Institute, walking by instinct, and
seeing nothing till he was under the lettered lamp.&nbsp; He went
to the dressing-room and hurried into his flannels.&nbsp; In the
gymnasium the instructor, a brawny sergeant of grenadiers, was
watching some lads on the horizontal bar.&nbsp; Johnny approached
him with a hesitating request for a &ldquo;free spar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free spar, my lad?&rdquo; said the sergeant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&nbsp; Gettin&rsquo; cheeky?&nbsp; Want to
give me a hidin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sergeant,&rdquo; Johnny answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
such a fool as that.&nbsp; But I never had a free spar with a man
much heavier than myself, and&mdash;and I just want to try,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a comprehending twinkle about the sergeant&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
givin&rsquo; me near two stone&mdash;that&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re
a bit over eleven.&nbsp; Fetch the gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time Johnny would never have conceived the
impudence of asking the sergeant&mdash;once champion of the
army&mdash;for a free spar.&nbsp; Even a &ldquo;light&rdquo; spar
with <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the
sergeant was something of an undertaking, wherein one was apt to
have both hands full, and a bit over.&nbsp; But the lad had his
reasons now.</p>
<p>He dashed at the professor with a straight lead, and soon the
blows were going like hail on a window-pane.&nbsp; The sergeant
stood like a rock, and Johnny&rsquo;s every rush was beaten back
as by hammer-blows on the head.&nbsp; But he came again fresh and
eager, and buzzed his master merrily about the head, getting in a
very respectable number of straight drives, such as would knock
an ordinary man down, though the sergeant never winked; and
bringing off one on the &ldquo;mark&rdquo; that <i>did</i> knock
out a grunt, much as a punch in that region will knock one out of
a squeaking doll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady,&rdquo; the sergeant called after two long
rounds had been sparred.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get stiff if
you keep on at that rate, my lad, and <i>that&rsquo;s</i> not
what you want, I reckon!&rdquo;&nbsp; This last with a
grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been boxin&rsquo; regular
you know, just lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he added, as they
walked aside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your work keeps you in good
condition.&nbsp; Not quite so quick as you would ha&rsquo; been
if you&rsquo;d been sparrin&rsquo; every evening,
o&rsquo;course.&nbsp; But quick enough for your job, I
expect.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again Johnny saw the cunning
twinkle.</p>
<p>It was about closing time, and when Johnny had <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>changed his
clothes, he found the sergeant leaving also.&nbsp; He thanked him
and bade him good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, May,&rdquo; the sergeant called, and turned
into the street.&nbsp; But he swung back along the footpath after
Johnny, and asked, &ldquo;Is it to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t a sergeant&mdash;I&rsquo;m a
stranger.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a sergeant goes to that moral
establishment p&rsquo;raps,&rdquo; with a nod at the Institute,
&ldquo;but he behaves strictly proper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just a
chap out in the street that would like to see the fight,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; When is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know that myself,&rdquo; Johnny
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;like that, is it?&nbsp; Hum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
sergeant was thoughtful for a moment&mdash;perhaps
incredulous.&nbsp; Then he said, &ldquo;Well, can&rsquo;t be
helped, I suppose.&nbsp; Anyway, keep your left goin&rsquo;
strong, but don&rsquo;t lead quite so reckless, with your head up
an&rsquo; no guard.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re good enough.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; the bigger he is, the more to hit!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>XXIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Butson</span> was perhaps a shade
relieved when he returned home that night and found all quiet,
and Johnny in bed.&nbsp; He had half expected that his
inopportune return might have caused trouble.&nbsp; But the night
after, as he came from the railway station, a little earlier than
usual, Johnny stopped him in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just come round by the dock wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was quiet and businesslike, but Mr. Butson
wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There are too many people
about.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s money in your pocket if you
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butson went.&nbsp; What it meant he could not imagine, but
Johnny usually told the truth, and he said it would be money in
his pocket&mdash;a desirable disposition of the article.&nbsp;
The dock wall was just round a corner.&nbsp; A tall, raking wall
at one side of a sparsely lit road that was empty at night, and a
lower wall at the other; the road reached by a flight of steps
rising from the street, and a gateway in the low wall.</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>&ldquo;Well, what is it now?&rdquo; Mr. Butson asked,
suspiciously, as Johnny stopped under a gas-lamp and looked right
and left along the deserted road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only just this,&rdquo; Johnny replied, with simple
distinctness.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wanted mother to give you my money
every week, though in fact she&rsquo;s been letting me keep
it.&nbsp; Well, here&rsquo;s my last week&rsquo;s
money&rdquo;&mdash;he shook it in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll give it you if you&rsquo;ll stand up here and fight
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; Fight you?&nbsp; You?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Butson laughed; but he felt a secret uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d rather fight a woman, no
doubt, or a lame girl.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m going to give you a
change, and make you fight me&mdash;here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnny
flung his jacket on the ground and his hat on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a young fool,&rdquo; quoth Mr.
Butson loftily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put on your jacket an&rsquo; come
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;presently,&rdquo; Johnny replied
grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Presently I&rsquo;ll go home, and take you
with me.&nbsp; Come, you&rsquo;re ready enough to punch my
mother, without being asked; or my sister.&nbsp; Come and punch
me, and take pay for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butson was a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a knife or a
poker or somethin&rsquo; about you like what you threatened me
with before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even brought a stick.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re the sort o&rsquo; <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>coward I expected, though
you&rsquo;re bigger than me and heavier.&nbsp; Come&mdash;&rdquo;
he struck the man a heavy smack on the mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butson snarled, and cut at the lad&rsquo;s head with the
handle of his walking stick.&nbsp; But Johnny&rsquo;s arm
straightened like a flash, and Butson rolled over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I thought you&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; remarked Johnny,
seizing his wrist and twisting the stick away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
get up.&nbsp; Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butson sat and gasped.&nbsp; He fingered his nose gently,
and found it very tender, and bleeding.&nbsp; He seemed to have
met a thunderbolt in the dark.&nbsp; He turned slowly over on his
knees, and so got on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit me&mdash;come, hit me!&rdquo; called Johnny,
sparring at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy I&rsquo;m only my mother, you
cur!&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;m hitting you&mdash;see!&nbsp;
So!&rdquo;&nbsp; He seized the man by the ear, twisted it, and
rapped him about the face.&nbsp; The treatment would have roused
a sheep.&nbsp; Butson sprang at Johnny, grappled with him, and
for a moment bore him back.&nbsp; Johnny asked nothing
better.&nbsp; He broke ground, checked the rush with half-arm
hits, and stopped it with a quick double left, flush in the
face.</p>
<p>It was mere slaughter; Johnny was too hard, too scientific,
too full of cool hatred.&nbsp; The wretched Butson, bigger and
heavier as he might be, was flaccid from soft living, and science
he had none.&nbsp; But he fought like a <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>rat in a
corner&mdash;recking nothing of rule, but kicking, biting,
striking, wrestling madly; though to small purpose: for his
enemy, deadly calm and deadly quick, saw every movement ere it
was made, and battered with savage precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; said Johnny,
as Butson staggered, and leaned against the wall, &ldquo;you can
stop it, you know, by calling the p&rsquo;lice.&nbsp; You like
the p&rsquo;lice.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s always one of &rsquo;em in
the next street, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve only to shout.&nbsp; I
shall hammer you till ye do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he hammered.&nbsp; A blow on the ear drove Butson&rsquo;s
head against the wall, and a swing from the other fist brought it
away again.&nbsp; He flung himself on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; cried Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get up.&nbsp;
What, you won&rsquo;t?&nbsp; All right, you went down by
yourself, you know&mdash;so&rsquo;s to be let alone.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m coming down too!&rdquo; and with that he lay beside
Butson and struck once more and struck again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chuck it!&rdquo; groaned Butson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
done!&nbsp; Oh! leave me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave you alone?&rdquo; answered Johnny, rising and
reaching for his jacket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not I.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t leave my mother alone a soon as she asked you, did
you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never pass you again without clouting your
head.&nbsp; Come home!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>He
hauled the bruised wretch up by the collar, crammed his hat on
his head and cut him across the calves with his own walking
stick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on!&nbsp; March!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you leave me alone now?&rdquo; whined
Butson.&nbsp; &ldquo;You done enough, ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not near enough.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
have a lot more if you don&rsquo;t do as I tell you.&nbsp; I said
I&rsquo;d take you home, an&rsquo; I will.&nbsp; Go
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three dark streets led to Harbour Lane, but they were
short.&nbsp; It was past closing time, and when they reached the
shop the lights were turned down and the door shut.&nbsp; Nan
opened to Johnny&rsquo;s knock, and he thrust Butson in before
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;not
thrashed half enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dusty and bleeding, his face nigh unrecognisable under cuts
and bruises, Butson sat on a box, a figure of shame.&nbsp; Nan
screamed and ran to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did it where the neighbours wouldn&rsquo;t
hear,&rdquo; Johnny explained, &ldquo;and if he&rsquo;d been a
man he&rsquo;d have drowned himself rather than come here, after
the way I&rsquo;ve treated him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a poor cur,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll buy a whip for him.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the
money I promised you&rdquo; he went on, putting it on the
box.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first you&rsquo;ve earned for
years, and the last you&rsquo;ll have here, if I can manage
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nan was crying over that dishonourable head, and wiping it
with her handkerchief.</p>
<h2><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>XXX.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Why</span> what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; said Long Hicks on the way to work in the
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Got cuts all over yer hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny answered laconically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fightin&rsquo;!&rdquo;&nbsp; Long Hicks looked mighty
reproachful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jest you be careful what company
you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; into,&rdquo; he said severely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re neglectin&rsquo; yer drawin&rsquo; and
everything lately, an&rsquo; now&mdash;fightin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t ashamed of it,&rdquo; Johnny replied
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got other things to
think about now, besides drawing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hicks stared, stuttered a little, and rubbed his cap over his
head.&nbsp; He wondered whether or not he ought to ask
questions.</p>
<p>They went a little way in silence, and then Johnny said:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him; Butson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Hicks, checking in his stride, and
staring at Johnny again.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&nbsp; Bin
fightin&rsquo; Butson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny poured out the whole story; and as he told
Hicks&rsquo;s eyes widened, his face flushed and paled, his hands
opened and closed convulsively, and again and again he blew and
stuttered incomprehensibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Job is, to drive the brute away,&rdquo; Johnny
concluded wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll stop as long as
he&rsquo;s fed.&nbsp; An&rsquo; <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>mother thinks it&rsquo;s a disgrace
to get a separation&mdash;goin&rsquo; before a magistrate
an&rsquo; all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only tellin&rsquo; you because I
know you won&rsquo;t jaw about it among the
neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day Long Hicks got leave of absence for the rest of the
week, mightily astonishing Mr. Cottam by the application, for
Hicks had never been known to take a holiday before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Awright,&rdquo; the gaffer growled,
&ldquo;seein&rsquo; as we&rsquo;re slack.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one
or two standin&rsquo; auf for a bit a&rsquo;ready.&nbsp; But
what&rsquo;s up with you wantin&rsquo; time auf?&nbsp;
Gittin&rsquo; frisky?&nbsp; Runnin&rsquo; arter the
gals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed Long Hicks spent his holiday much like a man who is
running after something, or somebody.&nbsp; He took a walking
tour of intricate plan, winding and turning among the small
streets, up street and down, but tending northward; through
Bromley, Bow and Old Ford, and so toward Homerton and the
marshes.</p>
<p>Meantime Johnny walked to and from his work alone, and
brooded.&nbsp; He could not altogether understand his
mother&rsquo;s attitude toward Butson.&nbsp; She had been
willing, even anxious, to get rid of him by any process that
would involve no disgrace among the neighbours, and no peril to
the trade of the shop; he had made her life miserable; yet now
she tended the brute&rsquo;s cuts and bumps as though he
didn&rsquo;t deserve them, and she cried more than ever.&nbsp; As
for Johnny himself, he spared Butson nothing.&nbsp; Rather he
drew a hideous <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>solace from any torture wherewith he might afflict
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going to clear out?&rdquo; he would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d rather be kept than work, but you
don&rsquo;t like being thrashed, do you?&nbsp; Thrashed by a boy,
eh?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll enjoy work a deal better than the life
I&rsquo;ll lead you here, I can tell you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make
you glad to drown yourself, mean funk as you are, before
I&rsquo;m done with you!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be too careful with
that eye: the sooner it&rsquo;s well, the sooner I&rsquo;ll bung
it up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessy marvelled at this development of morose savagery on her
brother&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; With her, though he spoke little, he
was kinder than ever, but it was his pastime to bully Butson: who
skulked miserably in the house, being in no fit state for public
exhibition.</p>
<p>As to his search for Nora Sansom, Johnny was vaguely surprised
to find himself almost indifferent.&nbsp; It would have been
useless to worry his mother about it now, and though he spent an
hour or two in aimless tramping about the streets, it was with
the uppermost feeling that he should rather be at home, bullying
Butson.&nbsp; He had no notion why, being little given to
introspection; and he was as it were unconscious of his inner
conviction that after all Nora could not be entirely lost.&nbsp;
While Butson&rsquo;s punishment was the immediate concern, and as
the thing stood, the creature seemed scarce to have been punished
at all.</p>
<h2><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>XXXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Long Hicks&rsquo;s</span> holiday had
lasted three days, and Mr. Butson&rsquo;s minor bruises were
turning green.&nbsp; It was at the stroke of five in the
afternoon, and Bessy was minding shop.&nbsp; From the ship-yard
opposite a score or so of men came, in dirty dungaree (for it was
Friday), vanguard of the tramping hundreds that issued each day,
regular as the clock before the timekeeper&rsquo;s box.&nbsp;
Bessy rose on her crutch, and peeped between a cheese and a
packet of candles, out of window.&nbsp; Friday was not a day when
many men came in on their way home, because by that time the
week&rsquo;s money was run low, and luxuries were barred.&nbsp;
Bessy scarce expected a customer, and it would seem that none was
coming.</p>
<p>Peeping so, she grew aware of a stout red-faced woman
approaching at a rapid scuttle; and then, almost as the woman
reached the door, she saw Hicks at her heels, his face a long
figure of dismay.</p>
<p>The woman burst into the shop with a rasping shriek.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want my &rsquo;usband!&rdquo; she screamed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my &rsquo;usband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come away!&rdquo; called Hicks, deadly pale, and <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>nervously
snatching at her shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come away!&nbsp; You know
what you promised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take yer &rsquo;and auf me, ye long fool!&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my &rsquo;usband?&nbsp; Is it you what&rsquo;s got
&rsquo;im?&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned on Bessy and bawled the words
in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no it ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Hicks, near
beside himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come away, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll talk about it outside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk!&nbsp; O yus, I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;im
talk!&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s every syllable was a harsh
yell, racking to the brain, and already it had drawn a group
about the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;im talk,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;er too!&nbsp; Would anyone believe,&rdquo; she
went on, turning toward the door and haranguing the crowd, that
grew at every word, &ldquo;as &rsquo;ow a woman calling
&rsquo;erself respectable, an&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; a shop like
any lady, &rsquo;ud take away a respectable woman&rsquo;s
&rsquo;usband&mdash;a lazy good-for-nothin&rsquo; scoundril as
run away an&rsquo; left me thirteen year ago last
Whitsun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boys sprang from everywhere, and pelted in to swell the crowd,
drawn by the increasing screams.&nbsp; Many of the men, who knew
the shop so well, stopped to learn what the trouble was; and soon
every window in Harbour Lane displayed a woman&rsquo;s head, or
two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My &rsquo;usband!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my
&rsquo;usband?&nbsp; Show me the woman as took my
&rsquo;usband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan came and stood in the back parlour doorway, frightened but
uncomprehending.&nbsp; The woman turned.&nbsp; &ldquo;You!&nbsp;
You is it?&rdquo; she shrieked, oversetting a pile <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>of tins and
boxes, and clawing the air above her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gimme back my
&rsquo;usband, you shameless creechor!&nbsp; Where
&rsquo;a&rsquo; ye got &rsquo;im?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my
&rsquo;usband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hicks put his arm about the woman&rsquo;s waist and swung her
back.&nbsp; He was angry now.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring you to make a row like
that!&nbsp; You swore you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding his arm too strong for her, the woman turned on Hicks
and set to clawing at his face, never ceasing to scream for her
husband.&nbsp; And then Johnny came pushing in at the door,
having run from the far street-corner at sight of the crowd.</p>
<p>Hicks, as well as he could for dodging and catching at the
woman&rsquo;s wrists, made violent facial signals to Johnny, who
stared, understanding none of them.&nbsp; But he heard the
woman&rsquo;s howls for her husband, and he caught at her
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is your husband?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;is name?&nbsp; Why
Butson&mdash;&rsquo;enery Butson&rsquo;s &rsquo;is name!&nbsp;
Gimme my &rsquo;usband!&nbsp; My &rsquo;usband!&nbsp; Let me go,
you villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was like an unexpected blow on the head to Johnny, but,
save for a moment, it stunned not at all&mdash;rather roused
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch him!&rdquo; he cried, and
sprang into the house.</p>
<p>Here was release&mdash;the man had another wife!&nbsp; He
would drag the wretch down to her, and then give him <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>to the
police.&nbsp; No wonder he feared the police!&nbsp; The load was
lifted at last&mdash;Butson&rsquo;s punishment was come
indeed!&nbsp; Fiercely glad, and thinking of nothing but this,
Johnny swung into each room in turn.</p>
<p>But there was no Butson.&nbsp; His pipe lay broken on the
front bedroom fender, and his coat hung behind the door; but
there was no other sign.</p>
<p>Johnny dashed into the back yard.&nbsp; That, too, was
empty.&nbsp; But in the yard behind, the old lighterman,
paint-pot in one hand and brush in the other, just as he had
broken off in the touching up of his mast, stood, and blinked,
and stared, with his mouth open.&nbsp; His house-doors, back and
front, stood wide, because of wet paint, and one could see
through to the next street.&nbsp; It was by those doorways that
Mr. Butson had vanished a minute ago, after scrambling over the
wall, hatless, and in his shirt sleeves.&nbsp; And the old
lighterman thought it a great liberty, and told Johnny so, with
some dignity.</p>
<p>Johnny rushed back to the shop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bolted out at the back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have offered chase, but his mother lay in a swoon,
and Bessy hung over her, hysterical.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shove that
woman out,&rdquo; he said, and he and Hicks, between them, thrust
the bawling termagant into the street and closed the door.</p>
<p>Without, she raged still, and grew hoarser, till a <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>policeman
came to quiet her; and in the end she marched off with him,
talking at a loud scream all the way.&nbsp; And Harbour Lane
flamed with the news of Nan&rsquo;s shameless bigamy.</p>
<h2><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>XXXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Long Hicks</span> raved and tore at his
hair, striding about the shop, and cursing himself with whatever
words he could find.&nbsp; Johnny was excited still, but he grew
thoughtful.&nbsp; There was more in this business, he saw now,
than the mere happy riddance of Butson.&nbsp; What of the
future?&nbsp; His mother was prostrated, and lay moaning on her
bed.&nbsp; No one was there to tend her but Bessy, and there was
no likelihood of help; they had no intimacy with neighbours, and
indeed the stark morality of Harbour Lane womankind would have
cut it off if they had.&nbsp; For already poor Nan was tried and
condemned (as was the expeditious manner of Harbour Lane in such
a matter), and no woman could dare so much as brush skirts with
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault&mdash;all of it!&rdquo; said the
unhappy Hicks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; bin
such a fool!&nbsp; But how was I to know she&rsquo;d go on like
that, after what she&rsquo;d agreed to?&nbsp; Oh, damme, I
shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; meddled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny calmed him as well as he might, pulled him into a chair
in the shop parlour, and sought to know the meaning of his
self-reproaches.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not meddle?&rdquo; <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>Johnny
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you found her kicking up that
row&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
protested Hicks, rolling his head despairingly and punching his
thigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I brought her here!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all my
fault!&nbsp; I thought I was doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; clever,
an&rsquo; I was silly fool!&nbsp; O, I&rsquo;d like to shoot
meself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought her here?&nbsp; Well, tell us about it&mdash;no
good punching yourself.&nbsp; When did you find out he was
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew it years ago; didn&rsquo;t know the woman was
alive, though.&nbsp; Thought she must &rsquo;a&rsquo; bin dead
when you told me he&rsquo;d married your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some light broke on Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you took these
days off to look for her&mdash;was that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I was a
fool&mdash;made things wuss instead o&rsquo; better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that&mdash;anything&rsquo;s better
than having that brute here.&nbsp; What changed your mind about
her being dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you all there is to
it.&nbsp; Long time ago when I was workin&rsquo; at
Bishop&rsquo;s an&rsquo; lodgin&rsquo; in Lime&rsquo;us, my
lan&rsquo;lady she knew Butson an&rsquo; &rsquo;is wife too,
an&rsquo; she told me they led a pretty cat an&rsquo; dog life,
an&rsquo; one day Butson hops the twig.&nbsp; Well his missus
wasn&rsquo;t sorry to lose &rsquo;im, an&rsquo; she sets to
washin&rsquo; an&rsquo; ironin&rsquo; to keep &rsquo;erself
an&rsquo; the kid.&nbsp; But when Butson gets out of <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>a job
(&rsquo;e was never in one long) &rsquo;e goes snivellin&rsquo;
round to &rsquo;er, an&rsquo; wants to go back, an&rsquo; be
kep&rsquo;.&nbsp; Well the missis makes it pretty &rsquo;ot for
&rsquo;im, you may guess; but she stands &rsquo;im for a week or
two, givin&rsquo; it &rsquo;im pretty thick all the time, till
Butson &rsquo;e cuts away again, an&rsquo; never comes
back.&nbsp; His missis never bothered about &rsquo;im&mdash;said
she was well quit.&nbsp; This was all before I went to live at
Lime&rsquo;us, but she used to be pals with my
lan&rsquo;lady.&nbsp; I kep&rsquo; a bottle o&rsquo; whisky then,
case of a friend comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; them two give it what
for, between &rsquo;em, on the quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you know her then&mdash;his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On&rsquo;y by sight, an&rsquo; not to say to speak to,
me bein&rsquo; a quiet sort.&nbsp; I knew Butson since&mdash;in
the shops; most took &rsquo;im for a bachelor.&nbsp; Well, I
wasn&rsquo;t at Lime&rsquo;us very long; I came away to this part
an&rsquo; see no more of &rsquo;er&mdash;though o&rsquo; course I
see &rsquo;im, often.&nbsp; When you told me &rsquo;e&rsquo;d
married your mother it took me aback a bit at first.&nbsp; But
then, thinks I, I expect the first one&rsquo;s dead&mdash;must
be.&nbsp; But after that, the other day, when you told me what a
right down bad &rsquo;un &rsquo;e was, I begun to think wuss of
&rsquo;im.&nbsp; I knew &rsquo;e&rsquo;d bin livin&rsquo; idle,
but I didn&rsquo;t guess &rsquo;e treated &rsquo;er so bad.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; when you talked o&rsquo; wantin&rsquo; to get rid of
&rsquo;im, I got a notion.&nbsp; If &rsquo;e&rsquo;s bad enough
for what &rsquo;e&rsquo;s done, thinks I, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s bad
enough for anythink.&nbsp; P&rsquo;raps &rsquo;is fust wife
&rsquo;s alive after all, an&rsquo; if she is, why the
job&rsquo;s done!&nbsp; Anyway, I puts it, I&rsquo;ll risk <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>a day or
two auf on it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I did, an&rsquo;
&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s a nice old bloomin&rsquo; mess I made!&nbsp;
Oh, I ought to be poleaxed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well of course there&rsquo;s been a row,&rdquo; Johnny
said gloomily, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I expect it&rsquo;ll knock trade
to pieces here, an&rsquo; half kill mother.&nbsp; But you
couldn&rsquo;t very well help a row in a thing like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bin three days findin&rdquo; &rsquo;er.&nbsp; My old
lan&rsquo;lady&rsquo;s dead, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;ad to try
an&rsquo; find &rsquo;er sister.&nbsp; Nobody knew where the
sister was, but after a lot o&rsquo; bother a old woman sends me
to a cousin&mdash;in the workus.&nbsp; Cousin in the workus
thinks the sister&rsquo;s dead too, but tells me to go an&rsquo;
ask at a newspaper-shop in Bromley.&nbsp; Newspaper-shop&rsquo;s
shut up&mdash;people gone.&nbsp; Find the man as moved &rsquo;em,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;e sends me to Bow&mdash;another
newspaper-shop.&nbsp; People there send me right back to Poplar;
party o&rsquo; the name o&rsquo; Bushell.&nbsp; Party o&rsquo;
the name o&rsquo; Bushell very friendly, an&rsquo; sends me to
Old Ford; then I went to Bow again, an&rsquo; so I dodged about,
up an&rsquo; down, till I run across Mrs. Butson up on
&rsquo;Omerton Marshes, keepin&rsquo; a laundry.&nbsp; That was
to-day, that was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she took it mighty cool at first.&nbsp; When I
told &rsquo;er I knew where &rsquo;er &rsquo;usband was, she told
me I might keep my knowledge to myself, for she didn&rsquo;t want
&rsquo;im.&nbsp; Very cool she was, till I told &rsquo;er
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d married again, an&rsquo; at that she shut
&rsquo;er jaw with a snap, an&rsquo; glared at me.&nbsp; So I
just told &rsquo;er what I knew, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ow it &rsquo;ud
be a charity <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>to give &rsquo;im a scare on the quiet, an&rsquo; send
&rsquo;im away from &rsquo;ere, an&rsquo; &lsquo;All
right,&rsquo; she says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jest you show me where they
live,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;im a
scare!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Right,&rsquo; says I, but I made
conditions.&nbsp; She wus to wait at the street-corner, an&rsquo;
I was to send in a message for &rsquo;im to come out.&nbsp; Then
we was to give &rsquo;im ten minutes to go an&rsquo; git
&rsquo;is clo&rsquo;es, if &rsquo;e wanted any, make any excuse
&rsquo;e liked, an&rsquo; clear out; so as to do it all quiet
an&rsquo; peaceable, an&rsquo; nobody the wiser.&nbsp; &lsquo;All
right,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;jest you show me the place,
that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo;&nbsp; So I brought &rsquo;er.&nbsp; But
when we got to the corner an&rsquo; I told &rsquo;er which
&rsquo;ouse, auf she went at a bolt, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
set up all that row &rsquo;fore I could stop &rsquo;er!&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought of &rsquo;er actin&rsquo;
contradictory like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not altogether so dense a mystery to Johnny as it was
to the simpler Hicks, twice his age, though more a boy than
himself.&nbsp; But he assured Hicks that after all he had done a
good turn, and no price was too high for riddance of
Butson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;ll be grateful to you, too,
when she&rsquo;s a bit quieter, an&rsquo; knows about it,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; And presently he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;I
think I ought to have guessed something o&rsquo; the sort, with
his sneaking in an&rsquo; out so quiet, an&rsquo; being afraid
o&rsquo; the p&rsquo;lice.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo;
things I see through now, that I ought to have seen through
before: not wantin&rsquo; the new name over the door, for
one!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>Till
the shutters were up that night, and the door well bolted, Nan
May was urgent that that horrible woman must be kept out.&nbsp;
And when at last she slept, in mere exhaustion, she awoke in a
fit of trembling and choking, beseeching somebody to take the
woman away.</p>
<p>Bessy, like Johnny, had a sense of relief, though she slept
not at all, and dreaded vaguely.&nbsp; But withal she was
conscious of some intangible remembrance of that red-faced woman
with the harsh voice; and it was long&mdash;days&mdash;ere it
returned to her that she had heard the voice high above the
shouts of the beanfeasters in the Forest on the day when Uncle
Isaac had brought Butson to the cottage.</p>
<h2><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>XXXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Dunkin&rsquo;s</span> notice to quit
arrived early the next morning.&nbsp; The service of that notice
was a duty he owed to society, morality, conscience, virtue,
propriety, religion, and several other things, which he
enumerated without hesitation.&nbsp; He could not have sat in his
pew the next day with any comfort, knowing that such a duty
remained unperformed; he would have felt a hypocrite.</p>
<p>The notice might have come before, for the trade had been good
and steady; but Mr. Dunkin also had heard the whispers that the
ship-yard might be shut, and he had hesitated long.&nbsp; Now,
however, there was no alternative&mdash;if Mrs. May were left to
flaunt her infamy the trade must decline under the scandal, and
the place fall worthless again.&nbsp; More, her expulsion at this
time would seem less a seizure of the new branch than a popular
vindication of righteousness.</p>
<p>Johnny was at home when the notice came.&nbsp; He had sent a
message to Mr. Cottam, pleading urgent family affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have expected it,&rdquo; Johnny said, giving the
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>paper to
Hicks, whom he had called into counsel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway
mother swears she can&rsquo;t show her face in the shop
again.&nbsp; She seems almost afraid to come out of her bedroom,
talks wild about disgracing her children, an&rsquo; wishes she
was dead.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s pretty bad, an&rsquo; as to the
shop&mdash;that&rsquo;s done up.&nbsp; Question is what to do
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hicks rose to his feet, and met the occasion face to
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do this thing between us,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and damn everybody!&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t a man
o&rsquo; business, not special, but I got you all into this
&rsquo;ere mess an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll see you out of it, or
I&rsquo;ll bust.&nbsp; Fust thing, this &rsquo;ere Mr.
Dunkin&rsquo;s game&rsquo;s plain enough.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a very decent business goin&rsquo; on,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;e takes this excuse to collar it
&rsquo;isself.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t took the shutters down yet,
an&rsquo; we won&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em down.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
stick up a big bill &lsquo;Business come to a end,&rsquo; or such
other words, an&rsquo; let the customers go where they like
an&rsquo; &rsquo;ope they won&rsquo;t come back.&nbsp; Then
p&rsquo;raps &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll come along in a day or two
an&rsquo; offer to buy the stock, thinkin&rsquo;
&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll get it for next to nothin&rsquo;, you
bein&rsquo; all at sixes an&rsquo; sevens.&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t
sell it&mdash;not one farden candle.&nbsp; But we won&rsquo;t say
so.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll fight cokum.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
ask &rsquo;im to think over it for another day or two an&rsquo;
see if &rsquo;e can&rsquo;t make it a quid or two more.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll let it slide all the week if we do it right,
expectin&rsquo; to land us at the last minute an&rsquo; make us
take anythink.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll just be walkin&rsquo; the
stuff all away very quiet in the evenin&rsquo;s, in a barrer,
an&rsquo; then &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll come into a empty <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>shop
unexpected, an&rsquo; &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t know what the
customers is used to, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;im fits
for another week or two.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where shall we take the stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it?&nbsp; Lord, anywhere!&rdquo; replied Hicks,
with a sweep of the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty
o&rsquo; empty shops ready to be took everywhere.&nbsp; Why the
number I&rsquo;ve seen these two or three days &rsquo;ud surprise
ye!&nbsp; Some ain&rsquo;t as good as others p&rsquo;raps, but
that we&rsquo;ll settle in the week.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just
beginnin&rsquo; again, that&rsquo;s all, same as what ye did
three or four year back!&nbsp; Lord, we&rsquo;ll do it, I tell
ye&mdash;do it flyin&rsquo;!&rdquo;&nbsp; Long Hicks waved his
arms enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to the&mdash;the
ha&rsquo;pence,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps your
mother&rsquo;s got some, p&rsquo;raps she
ain&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t matter either way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
a single man, an&rsquo; bin in good work years, an&rsquo; I got a
bit in the savin&rsquo;s bank.&nbsp; All right!&nbsp; I
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to offer no favours, so don&rsquo;t sing
out!&nbsp; Sixpence in the pound&rsquo;s all I get out o&rsquo;
the Post Office, an&rsquo; that ain&rsquo;t much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
open to make it a bit more&mdash;three per cent. if ye
like&mdash;on loan; any security, or none&mdash;there&rsquo;s
plenty in the place in the Forest an&rsquo; the stock an&rsquo;
all&mdash;&rsquo;ave it yer own way.&nbsp; Business!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ard business!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all it is.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; now we&rsquo;ll clear decks.&nbsp; Fust, get your
mother an&rsquo; sister out o&rsquo; this, somewhere out o&rsquo;
Harbour Lane, where they ain&rsquo;t known, an&rsquo; where
they&rsquo;ll quit frettin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&nbsp; Hicks&rsquo;s impetuosity
left Johnny&rsquo;s wits lagging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temp&rsquo;ry lodgin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Needn&rsquo;t be
fur; next parish is as good as fifty mile auf, in London.&nbsp;
Better.&nbsp; An&rsquo; by George! now I think of it, I see the
very place when I was goin&rsquo; round.&nbsp; Party o&rsquo; the
name o&rsquo; Bushell, in Poplar.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ouse too big for
&rsquo;em&mdash;got a furnished bedroom to let; showed it me,
case I might know anyone an&rsquo; send &rsquo;em, them
&rsquo;avin&rsquo; done me a turn sendin&rsquo; me to Old
Ford.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;ll be two more rooms,
unfurnished, next week, tenant goin&rsquo; out&mdash;young gal, a
dressmaker.&nbsp; So we can take them too, if we get pushed,
an&rsquo; run the sticks in there.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s luck to
begin with!&nbsp; Why, things&rsquo;ll go like
clockwork!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hicks rushed off to make sure of the lodging, and in half an
hour was back with a four-wheeled cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get &rsquo;em down an&rsquo; pop &rsquo;em in
sharp,&rdquo; said Hicks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told the cabby
where to go.&nbsp; You go with &rsquo;em an&rsquo; make &rsquo;em
comfortable, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll wait &rsquo;ere till you come
back.&nbsp; Mind&mdash;people at the &rsquo;ouse on&rsquo;y know
she&rsquo;s in trouble &rsquo;cos &rsquo;er &rsquo;usband&rsquo;s
run away, an&rsquo; I paid a week in advance.&nbsp; Go
on&mdash;I&rsquo;ll keep out o&rsquo; the way in the back till
they&rsquo;re clear auf; they don&rsquo;t want to see
me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Nan and Bessy wore veils, and hurried into the cab, while
Johnny glowered fiercely at every face he could see turned toward
them.&nbsp; To Johnny the streets seemed <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>unreasonably familiar as the cab jolted through
them&mdash;unreasonably like what they were a day ago, before
this blow fell and knocked the world out of shape.&nbsp; They
went out through Blackwall Cross, by the High Street, and past
the Institute, where the familiar housekeeper&mdash;the
housekeeper who had given him Nora&rsquo;s farewell
letter&mdash;stood on the steps with a broom; through the two
streets, and past that corner where they had parted&mdash;it
seemed years ago.&nbsp; As to when they might meet again, and
how&mdash;that was not to be thought of now.&nbsp; His head was
too full already.</p>
<h2><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>XXXIV.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh</i>, <i>give us some time to blow the man
down</i>!&rdquo; roared Mr. Bushell, splashing and puffing amid
much yellow soap and cold water in the wash-house, whither he had
gone for a wash, on coming home from his tug.&nbsp; The voice
thundered and rolled through the house, and on the first floor,
strangers not used to it grew muddled in their conversation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blow the man down, bully, blow the man
down&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To my
Aye!&nbsp;&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow the man down!<br />
Singapore Harbour to gay London town&mdash;<br />
Oh, give us some time to blow the man down!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up on the first floor landing, &ldquo;A-a-ah! pore
dears!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bushell, fat and sympathetic, looking up
at Johnny, with her head aside and her hands clasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pore dears!&nbsp; No, nobody shan&rsquo;t disturb
&rsquo;em!&nbsp; Lor, &rsquo;ow I do feel for &rsquo;em;
an&rsquo; you too, Mr. May.&nbsp; Lucky you&rsquo;re growed up to
be a comfort to yer pore mar!&nbsp; There&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say
nothin&rsquo; about yer father!&nbsp; Runnin&rsquo; away so
disgraceful an&rsquo; all.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t think what
parents is comin&rsquo; to, some of &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the pore gal as is leavin&rsquo; the other two
rooms o&rsquo; Monday, now&mdash;sich a quiet, <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>well-be&rsquo;aved young lady; we wouldn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;a&rsquo; let &rsquo;em stop a week if it wasn&rsquo;t for
&rsquo;er sake, bein&rsquo; so &rsquo;ard to find a respectable
lodgin&rsquo;s with sich a mother.&nbsp; But
there&mdash;&rsquo;er mother worries the pore thing&rsquo;s life
out&mdash;alwis drinkin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; now she&rsquo;s
akchally in gaol for breakin&rsquo; a public-&rsquo;ouse
winder!&nbsp; An&rsquo; I sez&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public-house window!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s breath came
short and thick.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps I shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo;
mentioned it to a stranger, but lor, I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose
you know &rsquo;er, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Sansom.&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&nbsp; Show me!&nbsp; In here?&nbsp; Is
she in now?&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnny made dashes at divers
door-handles with one hand, while Mrs. Bushell, confounded and
scandalised, restrained him desperately by the opposite
arm.&nbsp; It took some impatient moments to make it plain to the
landlady that he intended no violent assault, nor, on
consideration, even the rudeness of dashing into a lady&rsquo;s
rooms unannounced.&nbsp; Whereupon Mrs. Bushell went to a door
and knocked, Johnny close at her heels.&nbsp; And presently the
door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Johnny, Johnny, I wish you hadn&rsquo;t! . . . We
shall only&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But with that the words died on
the breast of Johnny&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; Mrs. Bushell&rsquo;s
eyes opened round, and then her mouth; and then Mrs. Bushell went
off very quietly downstairs&mdash;eyes and mouth and face <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>all
round&mdash;and out into the wash-house; and &ldquo;Blow the Man
Down&rdquo; stopped in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you know what I said, Johnny!&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t&mdash;you know we can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let you go now.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got a disreputable mother now&mdash;or so they
say.&nbsp; Have you heard of yours&mdash;since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the infirmary&mdash;very bad.&nbsp;
Something&rsquo;s been forming on the liver for years, the doctor
says; and when she couldn&rsquo;t get anything to drink she broke
down at once.&nbsp; But what did you say about your
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told her the tale.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he
added in the end, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s in there, worn out an&rsquo;
broken down, an&rsquo; not a woman in the world to comfort her
but my sister.&nbsp; Come in, an&rsquo; help.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
they went in together.</p>
<h2><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>XXXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of a week Long Hicks
stood astounded at his own performances.&nbsp; At the end of a
year he was still astonished, and proud inordinately; and till
the end of his life he will never forget the smallest particular
of that week&rsquo;s exploits.&nbsp; The policeman who came with
a warrant for Butson, the young man from Mr. Dunkin, who came
about the stock, the other young man that came the next
time&mdash;he polished them all off, and half a dozen others, in
the most dashing and businesslike manner.&nbsp; He found a new
shop&mdash;found a score of shops, in fact, so that Nan May was
fain to rouse herself and choose, lest some hopeless sepulchre of
trade were rented without her knowledge.&nbsp; And this was good,
for it gave her work to do and to think of, and once set going,
she buckled to her task with all her old energy, and a world of
riper experience.&nbsp; The shop was not so fortunately placed as
that at Harbour Lane, and trade was never quite so good as it had
been there when at its best.&nbsp; More, its place was in a dingy
street, out of sight of the river and the ships.&nbsp; But it was
a fairly busy thoroughfare, and things could be sold there, which
was <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>the
main consideration.&nbsp; And it was Hicks&rsquo;s triumph to
stock this shop with the stock from Harbour Lane&mdash;conveyed
secretly by night, on a truck, with many chucklings, after
cunning putting-off of Mr. Dunkin.&nbsp; The tale whereof he
would tell ever after with bashful glee, together with the tale
of the sad emptiness and disorganisation of Mr. Dunkin&rsquo;s
new branch at its opening on Monday morning.&nbsp; And Uncle
Isaac (who found his niece&rsquo;s new shop ere long) assured the
listener by frequent proclamation, that Mr. Hicks was a gentleman
of vast business ability, and a genius at enterprise.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yus, a genius, that&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> say, Mr.
Cottam&mdash;a genius of uncommon talent.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a
wet afternoon, when Cottam and Hicks had taken ten minutes&rsquo;
shelter in the round-house by the quay-side: and presently were
joined by Uncle Isaac, on his way across from the docks.</p>
<p>Mr. Cottam grunted.&nbsp; He had met Uncle Isaac twice
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; Uncle Isaac went on, gazing at the uneasy
Hicks with steadfast admiration, &ldquo;Lord!&nbsp; If &rsquo;e
was on&rsquo;y ambitious&rsquo; &rsquo;e might be anythink!&nbsp;
What a ornament &rsquo;e &rsquo;d be to a Diplomatic
Corpse!&nbsp; Talk about Enterprise!&nbsp; Why at Enterprise
an&rsquo; any sort o&rsquo; circumventions
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s&mdash;why there,
<i>as</i> I alwis say, &rsquo;e might be Ambashador to &rsquo;er
Majesty&rsquo;s possessions!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>The
shower flagged, and men came out on the quays.&nbsp; Mr. Cottam
rose from the coil he had been sitting on, took his gaze out of
space, and fixed it on the wall over Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Mundy!&rdquo; he trumpeted, in the manner
of a man beginning a speech to an expectant multitude; raising
his forefinger to his shoulder and lowering it till it rested on
Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s chest; &ldquo;Mr. Mundy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he paused, and Uncle Isaac said, &ldquo;Yus, Mr.
Cottam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pause endured and grew impressive; till at last the
foreman&rsquo;s face relaxed, his gaze descended till it met
Uncle Isaac&rsquo;s, and he chuckled aloud, stabbing him
playfully with the forefinger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why&mdash;what a
windy ol&rsquo; kidder you are!&rdquo; said Mr. Cottam; and
stamped off along the quay, croaking and chuckling all over.</p>
<h2><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>XXXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> with the days and the months
Nan&rsquo;s sorrows fell from her, and their harder shapes were
lost in her remembrance; and the new days brought a new
peace&mdash;perhaps even a new dullness.&nbsp; For this was a
dull place, this street of flat walls, and grime, and anxious
passengers.&nbsp; But what mattered mere dullness of externals
when she had hard work to do, and a son to take pride in?</p>
<p>For Nora&rsquo;s sorrows, who shall speak?&nbsp; There was a
hospital bed that she knew well, a pillow whereon a slaty face
wasted and grew blank of meaning.&nbsp; And in the end there was
a day of driving wet in a clayey cemetery, a day of loneliness,
and wonder, and dull calm.</p>
<p>But that day went with the others, and that year went.&nbsp;
The streets grew sloppy with winter, dusty with summer: and smoky
geraniums struggled into bloom on window-sills, and died
off.&nbsp; Miles away the Forest gowned itself anew in green, in
brown and in white; and in green the exiles saw it, once a year:
but all its dresses were spread for Bessy still, in her
dreams.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>Two
years were gone, and Johnny was within five months of twenty-one,
and the end of his apprenticeship, when on a brave August day he
walked in the Forest alone.&nbsp; There would be no Forest
excursion for him next year, for then, with good fortune, he
would be upon the seas.&nbsp; For the firm had promised him the
recommendation that would give him a year&rsquo;s voyaging as
fourth engineer.</p>
<p>Bessy and Nora were sharing the holiday, but they were left to
rest at Bob Smallpiece&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; Bob, vast, brown,
and leathery, was much as ever.&nbsp; He had seen Johnny and
Bessy once each year, but not their mother, since&mdash;well
since he had gone to London to see his sister.&nbsp; He was not
sure whether he should go up to London again soon, or not.&nbsp;
Meantime he made tea for his visitors.</p>
<p>They had climbed the hill to gran&rsquo;dad&rsquo;s grave, and
they had found it green and neat: they had seen another,
fresh-closed, beside it, and wondered who was buried there; they
had gathered flowers in Monk Wood, and they had stayed long in
Loughton Camp; they had come again to the cottage on the
glen-side, and Johnny had had to stoop at the door to save his
hat, for indeed he was within two inches as big as Bob Smallpiece
himself; and now Johnny, being alone, took the path to Wormleyton
Pits.&nbsp; It was six years since he <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>had gone that way last, and he might
never go that way again.</p>
<p>Mainly his way lay as it had lain when he carried the basket
of sloes, that night when his grandfather had hunted his last
moth.&nbsp; Johnny had left childish fancies years behind him,
and now the trees were trees merely, one much as the rest, though
green and cheerful in the sunlight.&nbsp; But even as on that
night his mind had run on London, the longed-for London that was
his home now, and stale with familiarity, so now he turned over
once more the mystery of the old man&rsquo;s cutting off: and
with as little foreknowledge of the next chances in life&rsquo;s
hatful.</p>
<p>Here branched the track by which he had made for Theydon;
there was the tree under which he had last seen the old
man&rsquo;s lantern-light; and then the slade opened, glorious
with heather.&nbsp; Brambles and bushes about the pits were
changed&mdash;this grown higher and wider, that withered off; and
the pits&mdash;the smaller pits, at least, seemed shallow enough
holes under the eyes of a man of near six feet.&nbsp; The deepest
pit&mdash;<i>the</i> pit&mdash;was farthest; and Johnny could see
a man, whose figure seemed vaguely familiar, sitting on its
edge.</p>
<p>He picked his way across the broken ground and came to the pit
on the side opposite to the stranger.&nbsp; There was the hole
where the old man had taken his death-blow.&nbsp; Perhaps the
bottom had risen an inch or <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>so because of gravel-washings; but
the big stone in the middle was still plain to see.</p>
<p>The man opposite was trimming wooden pegs with a
pocket-knife.&nbsp; He wore corduroys, of a cut that Johnny held
in remembrance.&nbsp; Johnny watched for a few seconds, and then
the man turned up a leathery brown face, and Johnny knew
him.&nbsp; It was Amos Honeywell, notable as a poacher, and chief
of a family of poachers.&nbsp; Amos put a peg into his pocket and
began on another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Amos!&rdquo; called Johnny across the pit;
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked up, and stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I dun&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny gave him his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; answered Amos, putting away his peg
unfinished.&nbsp; &ldquo;Johnny May?&nbsp; The boy as used to be
along o&rsquo; oad May the butterfly man, as died in a axdent in
this &rsquo;ere very pit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;if it was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was that all right &rsquo;nough.&nbsp; But, why,
ye&rsquo;re twice as tall: an&rsquo; &rsquo;taren&rsquo;t so
long, nayther.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amos paused, staring mightily at
Johnny, and slapped his thigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the curiousest thing in natur, seein&rsquo; you
now, an&rsquo; here too.&nbsp; Did ye see e&rsquo;er a funeral
las&rsquo; Wednesday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>&ldquo;Up to chu&rsquo;ch where yer
gran&rsquo;father&rsquo;s buried.&nbsp; But
no&mdash;y&rsquo;aren&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; hereabout now,
o&rsquo; coase.&nbsp; Well it is the rarest conglomeration ever I
see, me seein&rsquo; you &rsquo;ere at this &rsquo;ere very pit,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;im buried on&rsquo;y las&rsquo; Wednesday,
an&rsquo; died in a accident too.&nbsp; Fell off a rick, he
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coopersale chap, he was, name o&rsquo; Stiles.&nbsp;
Lived here &rsquo;bout six year.&nbsp; But coase you
wud&rsquo;n&rsquo; know &rsquo;bout him; &rsquo;twere he as did
the accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the accident?&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amos Honeywell got up from his seat, and jerked his thumb
toward the pit-bottom.&nbsp; &ldquo;This here one,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yer gran&rsquo;father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo; you mean he killed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dun&rsquo;t much matter what ye call it now the
chap&rsquo;s dead, but I wouldn&rsquo;t put it killed&mdash;not
meanin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amos Honeywell came slouching along
the pit-edge, talking as he came.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, he was a
Coopersale chap an&rsquo; new here, an&rsquo; knowed few.&nbsp;
Well, he sees this here&rsquo;s a likely spot for a rabbit or so,
an&rsquo; he puts up a few pegs an&rsquo; a wire or two, just
arter dark: <i>you</i> know.&nbsp; In the middle of it he sees a
strange oad chap comin&rsquo; with a lantern,
searchin&rsquo;&mdash;searchin&rsquo; what for?&nbsp; Why for
wires, he thinks, o&rsquo; coase.&nbsp; He hides in some
brambles, but t&rsquo;oad chap gets nigher an&rsquo; nigher
an&rsquo; presen&rsquo;ly Stiles he sees he&rsquo;s about
caught.&nbsp; So he ups on a sudden an&rsquo; knocks the oad chap
over, an&rsquo; grabs the wires an&rsquo; then <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>he
bolts.&nbsp; Oad chap goes over into pit of a lump, an&rsquo; he
falls awk&rsquo;ard an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; well&mdash;there
y&rsquo;are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long ha&rsquo; you known this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Knowed</i> it?&nbsp; Knowed it all time, same as
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; never said a word of it, nor told the
police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no,&rdquo; Amos answered, with honest
indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wudn&rsquo;t hev us get the poer chap
in trouble, wud ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was the mystery: nothing of wonder at all, nothing
but a casual crossing of ways: just a chance from the hatful,
like all the rest of it.&nbsp; And Amos&mdash;well, he was right,
too, by such lights as he could see.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>Light was low behind the hills, and dusk dimmed the
keeper&rsquo;s honest face as he waved his friends goodbye.&nbsp;
Yes, he would come to them in London, one of these days.&nbsp;
Soon?&nbsp; Well, then, soon.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Together the three went down the scented lanes, where the
white ghost-moths began to fly, and so into the world of new
adventure.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
